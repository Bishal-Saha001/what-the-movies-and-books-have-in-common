901,16137127,Certainty and the Search for Absolute Truth,eng,"Wait! Before you fly into that building...
What is truth? Is it knowable?
Can we be absolutely certain about anything?
A momentous work of philosophy doesn't have to be massive and unreadable. No example of philosophy that you'll encounter will deal with Certainty and Truth more concisely and compellingly than this book, yet it does so while maintaining an engaging style that keeps the cerebral content very readable and accessible. Like previous philosophies that address Certainty and Truth, the work HAD to address the issue of God, yet unlike it's predecessors, manages to do so without any hidden assumptions. As a result, it holds confirmations of orthodox Christianity that are unprecedented.
The book adopts a partially autobiographical style as it details how the hyper-rational author went from the purest form of agnosticism to fundamentalist Christianity over a span of years. Within are essays that address common misconceptions that skeptics and Christians share. There is also a miraculous quality to the account that speaks to the heart.
The fact that the author is a recent stroke victim, cognitively impaired and partially paralyzed, makes it more apparent that he cannot take credit for any cleverness reflected in this book. There are things on a par with Einstein's ""On The Photoelectric Effect"" or ""On Brownian Motion"" Since the author admits to having the barest of math abilities, it's fortunate that the issues in this work do not require the same mathematical rigor to express as Einstein's remarkable understandings. Nevertheless, the assertion of novelty and momentousness for this work is appropriate. There are intellectually satisfying answers to questions that people have grappled with for centuries. Questions like:
To what extent is anything knowable?
How can Jesus be the Son of God and God Himself?
How can a loving God send anyone to Hell?
What is Heaven and why will it be replaced?",[],1.0,162.0,1.0,1.0,0.10802636091067205,1.0,0.08689331125642112,0.09902597863114965,0.09849976387350814,0.09240726082626552,1.0,0.08813067960428737,1.0,0.07220978117517415,0.10348167091203565,0.08537625604492607,1.0,0.06847770612348969,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

16188,18512518,The Legal Status of Transsexual and Transgender Persons,eng,"The need to allow a change of legal sex/gender in certain cases is no longer disputed in most jurisdictions, and for European countries there is no question as to whether such a change should be allowed after the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Goodwin v. United Kingdom (Application no. 28957/95). The question has therefore shifted to what the requirements for such a change of the legal sex/gender should be. Many jurisdictions have legislated or developed an administrative approach to changing sex/gender, but the requirements differ significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, particularly with regard to age, nationality and marital status, as well as the medical and psychological requirements. The latter in some jurisdictions still include surgery and sterility as a precondition, thus potentially forcing the persons concerned to choose between the recognition of their sex/gender identity and their physical integrity. This book examines questions that are thus far under-researched, namely what the full legal consequences of a change of legal sex/gender should be, for example with regard to existing legal relationships such as marriages and registered partnerships, but also concerning children and parentage. The Legal Status of Transsexual and Transgender Persons is the result of an international research project, including not only national reports from 14 European and non-European jurisdictions but also two chapters that look at legal sex/gender changes from a Christian perspective and one chapter from a medical-psychological perspective. The final comparative chapter compares and contrasts the different approaches and requirements and makes recommendations for best practice and law reform.",[],1.0,678.0,1.0,1.0,0.06375609572390051,0.06006896282321674,0.060557502519514514,1.0,1.0,0.05498777489921375,0.06078627010338355,0.05590518989901352,0.0661320171851014,0.049971268041045944,0.06048325016454796,1.0,1.0,0.04200784832099871,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Battling against hypocrisies, sadomasochism and perfunctory pursuits of pop benchmarks of successes, he refuses the passion-oriented male worldview of karma and life's purposes. Metamorphosed by compassion, that love's innocence fills him with, he opts for a journey that takes him far away from the stupidity of self-worth, calculated in terms of personal utility, individualistic possession and unfettered consumption. Does he arrive?
Mayank Mishra, a 34-year old news-editor with a newspaper in an Indian city, takes up the challenges in his personal as well as professional lives; caught between the conflicting agendas of passion and compassion. His passion calls him to battle the hypocrisies, which the popular benchmarks of the societal notions fill up his professional as well as personal universe with. Then, the innocence of love and total intimacy exposes him to compassion, leading him to diametrically opposite life energies, marked by forgiveness. He realizes; he standing beyond the best of the potentials and capabilities of his 'acultured' and uninhibited mind is his own God but he needs an unlearning mechanism to delete the wrong programming of his mind.
In the contemporary worldview, which paints the hypocrisy of art and lies about idealisms; he templates sketches of heroic moments of personal crises to break free from the suffocation of the optionlessness of pop success, with humble reception of the sanity of simplicity and innocence.
How he manages his personal and societal conflicts, rises above his encumbrances and finally picks up a road less traversed for a journey, which makes him feel he has already arrived, sums up the novel.",[],1.0,191.0,1.0,1.0,0.07668454311690293,0.08612519610150728,0.07111868145463751,1.0,1.0,0.08744626890275566,1.0,0.08258054972554613,0.05862806554420426,0.0866226509686252,0.06529403225396237,1.0,0.07677957187892519,0.05493300971358425,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Others of you may know of me as a result of vicious lies which have been spread around about me allegedly extorting the publisher of this book. In fact, I'll be talking with the creative director of Dope Enterprises about that press release and those status updates with the #help hashtag in short order. Anyway, I've taken it upon myself to rename this entire series and have since retroactively included that first Criticality novel and this second novel as a part of my new True Hate Trilogy. I know - I know: This is supposed to be Acro's series, but your protagonist chooses to hide like a scared child instead of facing me like an adult. And that's fine. People will die. That's fine. Eventually, your 'hero' will grow tired of using the rest of you as shields - that or, he'll run out of them. I certainly won't tire of taking you or anybody else in my way out until I get to him. Unless there's controversy, stupidity, or tragedy, people don't seem to want to get behind it, and I don't have a budget, so yes, I guess it's going to be all of the above.

It argues that the plays are themselves a ""drama of masculinity,"" that is, dramatic activity specifically and self-consciously concerned with the fantasies and anxieties of being male in the urban, mercantile worlds of their performance. It further contends that the plays in their historical performance contexts produced and reinforced masculine communities defined by occupation, thus visibly naturalizing the world of work as masculine. The book offers welcome insight into a significant, canonical genre of dramatic literature that has been studied previously in devotional and civic contexts, but not yet in its role in the cultural history of masculinity.",[],1.0,228.0,1.0,1.0,0.06415607988116118,1.0,0.053372761515846086,1.0,0.06525218185647283,0.06471666529709379,1.0,1.0,0.05685461541505154,0.06063593509705104,0.060597840011430044,0.05743120703443458,0.061626990561983286,0.05394626728020814,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We live in 'exciting times'. Successions of stunning electoral defeats for the forces of liberalism are symptoms of a citizens' revolt against the elites and their democratic deficit.
These populist rebellions are incoherent, powerful yet literally reactionary, responses to globalism. The millions of citizens who have slapped the elites in the face know what they are against, but have no guiding vision of what they are for.
The resulting lack of direction is very dangerous. The globalists have been shaken to the core, but they are already regrouping and planning their counter-attacks. This renewed danger can only be met if the forces of tradition and identity develop a coherent, positive vision for a better future.
Populist revolts are not enough. For secure, lasting victory they have to be transformed into full-scale National Revolutions. But there can be no revolution in action without first a revolution in ideas and in the hearts of future revolutionaries.

But in the case of this book such praise is only half of the golden apple. Without an excellent or, more precisely, a fully adequate translator, the poet's name would be meaningless to most people, and a book of bad translations would distort his name. Makhno is very lucky to have found an adequate English-language translator. Orest Popovych, although (or, perhaps, because) he is a scientist by profession, is able to capture not only the text but also the subtext of this poetry. Never attempting, as some poet-translators do, to outsing the original song, Popovych attentively listens not only to he words but also to the melody and spirit of these poems long before putting pen to paper. As a result, those who do not have the Ukrainian language, may rest assured that they get the kernel of these powerful texts, and those who do will delight in the translator's art.

While his new landlady is pleasant enough, Martin quickly learns that her husband left her for a barmaid, and she's become particularly hostile to men. When she assigns her new boarder a number of domestic chores, he willingly agrees. And so begins Emma's deliberate scheme to make Martin her slavish houseboy.

453739,19066276,"Ballots, Bullets & Kabulshit: An Afghan Election",en-US,"Ahead of the 2009 presidential elections in Afghanistan, Australian electoral advisor and Gruen Planet panellist Toby Ralph joined a UN team to assist local authorities unused to free and fair democratic processes - and in some cases, not keen on adopting them. Amid the 'War on Terror', resistance ranged from corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude to lethal violence.
Ralph's diarised account is a rare glimpse into the day-to-day experiences of those charged with delivering the freedom and democracy Western leaders promise the disenfranchised. With the wry humour of a seasoned politico (or someone trying to distract themselves from the very real dangers of their situation), he provides snapshots of life in Kabul, a primer in the political shambles of a failing state, and the reflections of a non-combatant working in a war zone in a suit and tie. He is whisked between meetings in armoured cars, tries to avoid sitting on the AK-47 down the back of the couch at his lodgings, dines with colleagues in sandbagged candlelit restaurants, and attempts to convince the Electoral Commission chairman - and friend of President Hamid Karzai - that having an election is a good idea.

Author of such successes as American Song, American Child and The Word of Love, Mr. Engle ranks high among poets of affirmation, and is read by thousands of readers for his celebration of the basic human virtues and his emphasis on American themes.
This book is a departure from his earlier work since it opens with a sequence of poems under the general title of A Woman Unashamed, which, in effect, is a narrative poem placed in Japan. It contains some of the most distinguished work Mr. Engle has done in recent years.

126221,25881866,Lusting After the Cook,eng,"Dear Author,
There he is. Gods, I love it when he cooks. I wandered in here the second day that I was living in this wretched city. A block away from my apartment, the smells emanating from this Mongolian grill drew me in like a fly to honey. The food was decent, and I thought I might come here every once in a while when I didn't feel like cooking. Then I saw him. Hat on backwards, tattoos decorating his delectable skin, and the smile he gave me when I stepped up to the grill with my bowl of ingredients. *swoon*
It's been a month now, and I eat here every day. Either for lunch or for dinner, it doesn't matter to me. I think one of the waiters has realized why I come in. Whenever Darren isn't on shift, he gives a knowing smile and says, ""I'll get you a menu, Stefan.""
Photo Description:
A man dressed in black, hat backwards, is working at a Mongolian Grill as a cook.

In Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America and the UK, edited by Maggie O'Sullivan (London: Reality Street, 1996), Darragh explains that the title comes from ""a public library display of old 'advertising fans' ripped so that words from other fans and/or the display's backdrop showed through. At the time I was trying to figure out if a poem could be in the form of a theater with words/sounds in every seat. The image in my mind was a Hannah Weiner performance in DC in the early '80s in which voices arose from the audience in conjunction with Hannah reading alone on stage. I wanted to ""build"" a poem based on my memory of that reading, avoiding both the ""naturalization"" and stigmatization of multiple, overlapping voices.

A concurrent desire was to investigate what went wrong with language in 1968. I remembered the dissolution of alternative living arrangements and businesses as beginning with words -- the failure of political projects as being partly a language problem.

Now that the idea and opportunity was there, he was intrigued enough to learn more. Sebastian definitely wanted Gavin. The only problem was Sebastian also wanted the one woman he'd denied for most of their lives, his best friend and house mate, Carissa.
Gavin had wanted the owner and chef of his favorite Bistro for some time now, but he'd also had his attention on the chef's lady friend. The fiery red head had captured him from the first time he set eyes on her. Gavin had been looking for the person he could love and spend the rest of his life with; he just wondered if one or both of them could be the solution and become the love he'd been looking for.
This story continues from Shared Desires Book 1: Gavin's Search.
Excerpt
Sebastian Hartwell sat at a table in the back of the dining room of his Italian Bistro doing paperwork and setting up next month's schedule. It was almost closing time. He wasn't in the mood to deal with anymore problems tonight. He'd already been here preparing dishes since opening this morning. His other chef had called off with only a few moments notice so there was no one he could call.
Someone stepped up to his table. If this was another problem, he just might blow his top.
Sebastian didn't even look at the person. ""Can I help you?"" he asked, thinking it was one of his employees.
""I certainly hope so.""
Sebastian laid down his pen at the rich, seductive voice. He had to see what the man looked like who spoke in such tones. The man had to be at least six foot two or three and somewhere between one ninety to two hundred pounds, there wasn't an ounce of fat anywhere on his well-proportioned body.
The man's black slacks looked like they were molded to his body. His white dress shirt was tucked into the waist of his pants and was hanging half-unbuttoned, and the sleeves were rolled up to just below his elbows.
From what Sebastian could see, the man's skin was dark bronze and flawless, his long coal black hair was pulled back in a ponytail. His face was chiseled and so handsome it was almost breathtaking. His brown eyes, so deep and secretive, his full pink lips looked soft and very kissable. The man looked and smelled like temptation itself. He had seen the man in here before, many times, but never this close.
""Was there a problem with your meal or your service this evening?"" Sebastian questioned.
""No,"" the man shook his head. ""Everything was to my satisfaction. It always is when I eat here.""
""Was there something else I could do for you?"" Sebastian certainly hoped there was something he could do for this sexy stranger.
""Have you ever been with a Dom?"" the man asked point blank, and Sebastian wondered how the stranger even knew he was gay.
""No,"" Sebastian stated with a slight chuckle. ""Do I strike you as a man who wants to be told what to do and when to do it?""
""I'm not sure what sort of man you strike me as being. Maybe it was just wishful thinking on my part. Still I have to ask. Would you ever consider giving it a try?""
""Are you seriously asking me to be your submissive?"" Sebastian asked, his voice sounding almost comical and a little uncertain, nothing like he wanted it to sound.
""If I am?"" the man questioned arching one black brow.
""What makes you think I'm into men? I happen to be living with a very beautiful woman.""
""There's absolutely nothing wrong with liking or wanting both. Are you in love with this beautiful woman that you're living with?""
""I love her,"" Sebastian said with a nod of his head.
""Would you consider meeting with me and perhaps having a talk over drinks or dinner to get to know one another?"" the stranger asked.
""Why don't you leave me your number and I'll think about it and get back to you.""
Sebastian watched as the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a business card and pen. He scribbled something on the back of it and then held it out to him. ""My name is Gavin and that's my personal cell number on the back of that card, call me anytime.""
""I'm Sebastian,"" he said as he reached out to take the card. His fingers brushed the other man's slightly. A spark of electricity went up his arm and through his body. Sebastian's cock immediately surged to attention, pulsating against the zipper of his white chef's pants.
""Don't make me wait too long, Sebastian."" Gavin's demand was soft.",[],1.0,57.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.2208503819992209,0.2336325550519961,0.18564521578386664,1.0,0.18456584957769476,0.23638049455136795,0.1813889666321139,0.22755232218558877,0.17118138248541337,0.23378962890108346,1.0,1.0,0.13951881923370266,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

228122,3440633,Issue Voting: An Introduction,eng,"In our poll-driven age, political attitude surveys have become something of an academic industry. Researchers have proposed numerous models to explain the relationship between a particular issue and voter behavior, but there is no consensus on which approaches work best. Issue Voting offers a welcome overview of the various models in use today, their strengths and their shortcomings. In the early days of democracy, issues played a leading role in shaping American and Western European party systems. Liberal parties were formed explicitly to combat privilege, conservative parties to defend the military or the monarchy, socialist parties to champion unions, agrarian parties to campaign for the redistribution of land. By the time the first election studies came out in the 1940s, however, issue voting was of minor importance. Instead, the vote of the ordinary citizen reflected group norms - class, ethnic, religious and geographical norms - and the main factor in voting behavior was party identification, followed by candidate identification. In the early 1970s, evidence emerged of a surge in issue voting, and since then, political writers have proposed many models to describe its mechanisms. Yet their suggestions tend to be found in either professional articles that focus on some isolated aspect of issue voting, or single-election studies, a chapter of which sets forth some ad hoc model for the occasion. This volume provides a sorely needed overview of the approaches available. Ole Borre shows how the different models highlight consistency, position and issue distance, salience, valence issues and performance. He keeps the statistics simple, illustrating the various approaches with recent British and Danish election data and favoring linear regression whenever possible. Issue Voting will be invaluable to political scientists and modern historians trying to make sense of this quintessential democratic phenomenon.",[],1.0,160.0,1.0,2.0,0.044205661335537,0.04186682618080588,0.03646727656474818,1.0,1.0,0.037755642910874986,0.037034911029344086,1.0,0.040410734222537055,0.04200757859541498,0.035088111220198635,1.0,0.04262038146871401,0.0399273788807071,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Henriette let neither disapproval nor disbelief daunt her. In an astonishingly short fifteen-day period, she hatched her plan, organized provisions, and hired her retinue.
Throughout her adventure, Henriette kept a diary. She was a sharp-eyed observer, as conscious of the human drama she had set in train as the difficulties and beauties of the climb itself.

North of the Black Sea she found archaeological excavations of graves of Iron Age women buried with arrows, swords and armour. In the hidden world of the Hittites, near the Amazons' ancient capital of Thermiscyra in Anatolia, she unearthed traces of powerful priestesses, women-only religious cults, and an armed, bisexual goddess - all possible sources for the ferocious women.

A murder takes place in the dean's office of a law school, and the perpetrator, wearing a Donald Duck mask, flees after throwing his pistol to Dean Ansari. When the dean's secretary walks into the office, she sees Ansari standing over the body, gun in hand, and accuses him of murder. Giving a flimsy excuse, the dean vanishes. After a fruitless search for him, his secretary returns to discover that the body is gone. Only blood on the carpet remains. In a matter of minutes, three people have disappeared.
Thinking he might be wrongly convicted of a heinous crime, Dean Ansari escapes, panic-stricken, to India - the farthest place in his imagination. However, he leaves careless clues, and Detective Joe Walsh is able to trace him to Mumbai. He and the dean meet there and, not recognising each other, become friends.
During this time, Ansari falls in love with a Chinese courtesan who steals his money on orders from her pimp, Raji Rau. When the penniless dean realises he must leave again, he turns to her for help. They flee together, Ansari clueless that her generous offer to pay for their expenses is actually with his own money. Their escape is hardly the end of the dean's troubles. Other mishaps occur, and perplexing questions remain: Who was the person in the Donald Duck mask? Was there a murder? If so, what happened to the body? Does Joe Walsh ever catch up with Dean Ansari?

Aris tucked the barrel of his 9mm Beretta into the small of his back. ""SEER sha."" he repeated, having never heard the name before. The sound of it rolled off his tongue with the silky ease of a French kiss.
""It's Gaelic."" she said, as if the fire in her demeanor hadn't already told him that. ""Maybe your boy over there should move faster getting that trash can over here before she throws up on your shoe tops.""
This woman was no ordinary hostage, but then again, this wasn't a run of the mill bank robbery.
Armed with the idea that they were sent to end evil in the world, Aris and his team know that when you steal money from a bank, the government prints more. After all, it's only paper, until something goes horribly wrong.
Lives change forever on a warm sunny summer afternoon. A man dies, another is injured, a traitor is left behind, and one man's heart is taken.
It's only after things return to normal that Aris becomes aware that his thoughts are not where they should be. His body yearns for something he's only barely tasted. His heart is heavy with the burden of what he cannot have. Exhausting himself by day is the only way the still of the night doesn't become sheer torment. Lesser men would break and surrender, but Aris is not a weak man.
The impossible has to happen and Aris is determined it will. From squalor to poverty to a budget the size of a small nation, famine to fed, illiterate to educated, chaotic masses to well run organization, the pieces fall into place one by one over the course of seven years that lead him back to where his heart was lost.
""Ah. Rescuing a damsel in distress always puts a man on a pedestal in a woman's eyes."" he rolled his eyes.
""You tore my skirt, dropped my Choo's in the dirt, duct taped me to a stolen helicopter, and as if that wasn't enough fun for one day, I got to spend the rest of the week with the Feds. Oh, a pedestal by all means. How about a pedestal called the gallows!"" she didn't realize she was squeezing him as she got more wound up.
He would have liked nothing better at the moment than to wrap both of his arms around her, but this was a very upscale establishment where there were norms that had to be observed. Instead, he pulled her closer to him putting his hip back between hers, where they had started on the dance floor. His breath on her neck caused a shiver down her spine causing her hips to tilt into his. The fact that she noticed how well endowed he was made her that much angrier.

As witnessed during the very close 2014 referendum on Scottish independence and during the 2016 referendum on British EU membership, sub-state national identities in Britain remain strong and increasingly challenge the idea of a United Kingdom. In Britain Today, topics and key subjects are chosen to reflect the most important social, political, and cultural issues in Britain today, with a focus on those that Scandinavian lecturers and students will find particularly important and engaging.
Avoiding overly descriptive approaches, the book provides introductions to prominent ideas, social, political, and cultural critique and responses, all of contemporary relevance. In addition to providing the necessary basic and factual assignments, topics for presentations and essays, and literature for further reading. It thus sets stages that will enable students to critically relate to attitudes and ideas, and inspire their own in-depth exploration.
The chapters of the book are organised thematically and arranged in balanced and substantial modules. This means that each chapter can stand alone and need not be read or taught as part of a particular sequence.

Recent archeological discoveries have thrown a great deal of new light on the Bible. That is what this book is about. The author, John Elder, who lives in Iran, has for many years been surrounded by these archeological evidences, & has drawn freely upon the study & writing that has already been done as to their extent & interpretation. Using this material freely, he has told a story that is both coherent & dramatic & successfully brings together all relevant material as to the method, manner & meaning of the ""diggings"" which so often indicate that Bible references are not as obscure as some have thought, and that The Book is indeed rooted & grounded in history. He begins at the beginning, Genesis, & goes on thru Revelation. Those who have visited the Holy Land will get special delight from this book, for it will bring back to them with deeper meaning the scenes they have visited all too briefly.--Kirkus

On a dark night in a small South African church, Alec Rowlands encountered God in a staggering, powerful, and umistakable way. Though he was only eleven years old at the time, he knew that nothing would ever be the same.
Yet as Alec's journey continued -- he grew up, moved to America, and became a pastor -- he began to wonder why his spiritual life hadn't kept pace with his boyhood experience. Why did he so often feel God's absence more than his presence? Where was the passion he had once felt?
Compelled by his questions, Alec began to study historic revivals and transforming movements of God. What he discovered altered his perspective forever.
In The Presence, Alec shares what he has learned about the God who invites us into an encounter that C. S. Lewis likened to meeting an untamed lion. Whose very presence overwhelms our senses and transforms our lives. Who draws near and changes everything, including the way we think about God.

Soon after the publication, this book stirred controversy over the nature of male sexuality, male ""frigidity,"" and its connection to the ""Lolita complex."" Today, this work is considered a classic in Japanese men's studies.
The most striking feature of this book is that it was written from the author's first-person perspective. The author is a professor who teaches philosophy and ethics at a university in Japan, and in this book he talks about his own sexual fetishism, his feeling of emptiness after ejaculation, and his huge obsession with young girls and their developing female bodies. He undertakes a philosophical investigation of how and why sexuality took such a form within a person who had grown up as a ""normal,"" heterosexual man.
This may be the first case in which a philosopher delves deep into his own sexuality and poses an ambitious hypothesis about the formation of male ""frigid"" sexuality, which might actually be shared by many ""normal"" men in our society in a hidden way.

When Carrie accidentally-on-purpose breaks Michael's arm, a self-professed sorceress with a secret agenda of her own gives him a pill to magically heal the bones.

Max Bravo is a mid-rung opera singer with a diva's towering ego. And he doesn't do favors. Not until the day he visits a troubled friend in Berkeley and offers to walk her dog.
Max quickly discovers the local dog park. It's an odd, private little world--a preserve for neighborhood crackpots and lay-abouts, and, incidentally, their dogs.
But, the park regulars are friendly. Clubby. They even serve beer. Before long, Max can't stay away.
When one of the regulars disappears, Max's interest in the dog park turns to obsession. Amy Carter - beautiful, adored, pregnant - has vanished. The circumstances bode the worst.
What happened to Amy? The dog park club has brewed up a theory.

I rolled my eyes and ignored him. I had a job to do, and the sooner I got it done with, the sooner I could leave. I took another sip of my alcohol and watched my client.

359397,1001441,The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male,eng,"Fifteen years ago, when it was first published, ""The Transsexual Empire"" challenged the medical psychiatric definition of transsexualism as a disease and sex conversion hormones and surgery as the cure. It exposed the antifeminist stereotyping that requires candidates for transsexual surgery to prove themselves by conforming to subjective, outdated and questionable feminine roles and ""passing"" as women. Then as now, defining and treating transsexualism as a medical problem prevents the person experiencing so-called gender dissatisfaction from seeing it in a gender-challenging or feminist framework. Transsexualism goes to the question of what gender is, how to challenge it, and what reinforces gender stereotyping in a role-defined society. In the new introduction to this feminist work, Raymond discusses how these same issues are now debated in the context of transgender. Transgenderism reduces gender resistance to wardrobes, hormones, surgery and posturing - anything but real sexual equality. It assimilates the roles and definitions of masculinity and femininity, often mixing and matching, but never really moving beyond both.
In a similar way, transsexualism is thought to be a radical challenge to gender roles, breaking the boundaries of gender and transgressing its rigid lines. But if the transsexual merely exchanges one gender role for another, and if the outcome of such a sex reassignment is to endorse a femininity which, in many transsexuals, becomes a caricature of much that feminists have rejected about many-made femininity, then where is the challenge, the transgression, and the breaking of any real boundaries? This book will be used as a text in women's studies, psychology, sociology, technology and public policy, as well as by medical students, law students, and all who have an interest in feminist issues.","['747417', '823882', '1022', '1059288', '1266558', '79460', '304083', '1209346', '1218235', '370065', '419169', '7989737', '11497719', '44546', '280880']",81.0,264.0,21.0,2.24,0.07714498476855124,0.07195824215915897,0.06943545171170123,1.0,1.0,0.067112312625402,0.07240554285731488,0.0682358169407883,1.0,0.06359245091285826,0.07057390576351694,0.0764081415461891,1.0,0.05015435226015487,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

549142,4452520,Flesh is Heir: An Historical Romance,eng,"Lincoln Kirstein is well known as the founding director of the New York City Ballet, for his writings on dance, photography, painting, and sculpture. Known to few readers, however, is this early (1932)work, his only published novel, autobiographical in content but historical in scope and purpose.
In a revealing Afterword, Mr. Kirstein recalls his family background and education as well as the circumstances surrounding the writing of his novel. Family wealth and the ""permissive generosity"" of his parents gave him familiarity with ""a fraction of literary London, the main European museums, plus Northern Italy, Spain, and North Africa"" by the time he had completed his college education. He thus possessed a unique view, which inspired him ""to write an 'historical' novel which would utilize what I knew and felt about my own times in as pictorial a fashion as I might muster.""
Flesh is Heir is the story of a boy who serves as the type of the first generation arising in the United States after World War I. At boarding school he experiences mortal fear of a crazy classmate: in a glass works he sees the ironical cruelties of manual labor; in London and Paris he encounters the decadence of one pattern of life, and in Venice, the death of another.

A light romance book - titled The Sandy Shore - has many borrowers, some interesting, some dull. The book tells his own story and gives you snapshots of their lives as he sees them as borrowers. One borrower (Anne) buys it when the library closes in 1966. The character in the romance (Sandra) seeks new horizons in her fictional life and this resonates with Anne and she decides to do likewise in her real life. She awaits what chance serves up, like flotsam and jetsam on the shore where she lives in Pembrokeshire. She talks to Sandra as an intimate diary and to the book itself which, in her mind, becomes a personality (Book). An affair with an old boyfriend (Nelson) from Royal Navy days when she was a WRNS in a local naval station (Kete) has dramatic consequences.
The affair ends with an almighty bust-up when she realises he is as rotten as her navy friend naughty Christina always said he was.

353098,27191391,The Door to His Darkness,eng,"Dear Author,
In my world there are two ruling bodies; Demons and Shifters. My father is a Demon Lord but I'm Half Incubus and Half Warlock. My horns show my station as a demon, however, my different colored eyes show my dual blood. Because of my dual blood, there is a dark power inside me. I fear this power, and my father has kept me sheltered as he would destroy anyone who tried to use this darkness for their personal gain.
While at The Gathering, where all beings in power come together once every 100 years, I met someone. He's a Lycan and he's the most beautiful being I've ever seen. One night of passion is hardly anything to an Incubus like me but it was the most special night I had ever had. We both had a connection like no other, and to top it off, my taking of his life force did nothing but invigorate him.
As the son of a prestigious Lycan family, there is no way our union would be allowed with a half like me. When we are discovered, we're torn apart. When I hear of my beautiful Lycan being publicly punished by his family for tarnishing the family name, the darkness that I have so tried to keep locked away, is unleashed. I will not allow the one who has finally brought me peace and happiness to be hurt. Now everyone will learn of the monster we fought to conceal.

245885,15711483,Fools And Knaves: The True Story Of My Historic Presidential Campaign,eng,"FOOLS AND KNAVES: THE TRUE STORY OF MY HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, a political humor novel, is told to the author (and the reader) by fictional presidential candidate, Jim Johnson
Jim Johnson is an odd, cranky and wealthy retired Seattle businessman who serves on corporate boards. He gets into hot water when the press learns that one of his companies never paid a penny in taxes. Then a disgruntled employee leaks to the press that Johnson took personal tax deductions for depreciating his wife. Johnson defends himself by attacking his critics, suggesting that corporate values statements reveal the problem with companies today: They care more about integrity and quality than about making money.
Johnson receives what he thinks is his fifteen minutes of unwanted fame. A few days later, he comments on an article about whether the candidates for President are religious enough to hold the office. Johnson tops them all by claiming he's nine times more religious, feigning belief in nine gods. ""They believe in only one supernatural force for which there is no evidence,"" Johnson states. ""I believe in nine supernatural forces for which there is no evidence. Who has more faith?""
He is instantly anointed as a fresh personality in the Presidential sweepstakes. His new high profile lands him on Meet the Press, where he says more outrageous things including proposing Money (That's What I Want) as the new national anthem. Surprisingly, the voters agree that the Star Spangled Banner has lousy lyrics and is unsingable. Of course, Johnson has no intention of running for President....
Until his proposal to form two new political parties, The Fools and The Knaves, is embraced by the voters. Johnson often knew that Governor X or Representative Y was either a fool or a knave, but could not tell which. With the new parties in place, now they must declare their allegiances.
When Herman Cain, Michele Bachman, Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, and Ron Paul are presidential candidates, you might wonder if political satire is possible. The book's candidates -- from the pedantic President Bupka, who lectures the nation on word etymologies and proper pronunciation, to Senator Winthrop, who poll tests his faxes to God, to wealthy Voras Lucre, who refers to himself as The Magnificent One, to Liz Hatter, famous for killing her husband on reality TV Show Getting Away With Murder (Bravo had pre-negotiated immunity), to Johnson himself, who introduces ""fresh ideas"", such as two new economic indicia--The Cost of Living In Style (COLIS) and The Cost Of Living Like Pond Scum (COLPS) -- manage to be more venal, outrageous, and funnier than today's politicians.
As the economy careens from the Great Deflation Fear to the Great Panic, and the military mission to Greater Transcaucustania becomes ensnared in ethnic feuds between Chechens, Abkhazians, Balkars, Kazakhs, Nalkars, Turkmen, Armenians, Kabardians, Inguish, Dungans, Azerbaijanis, Dagestanis Karachays, Kalmyks, Kyrgyz, Lak, Lezgi, Tabasaran, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Cherkess, Dargins, and endless other groups, scandals entrap leading candidates, and Johnson finds himself ahead in the polls, until questions about his background arise.
Did he really inspect his neighbor's garbage? Worship terrorist gods? Cheat at golf? Use a French auto mechanic? Consistently lie to a Catholic Priest during his childhood confessions?
Will Big B, the obnoxious Fox News conspiracy theorist and now the Knave candidate, use slurs and innuendo to defeat Johnson as he did with the others?

Successfully ensconced at a famous salon on Madison Avenue, he now wants to see his lover get ahead. The problem is, gorgeous Ricky Hart has strayed from building on past achievements as an actor. He's lost touch with his passion to build a career as a Broadway performer and now works as a bartender. Stuck in a rut of sleeping all day after partying all night, he's ceased going to classes and auditions; even his agent has abandoned interest in helping him. While Bobby means well, his attempt to jolt Ricky into action by pointing out this backward slide only serves as a wedge in their relationship. One of Bobby's biggest clients, however, is a powerful casting director, and Bobby promises Ricky the opportunity to show the woman his talent. Now, Ricky must dig down into his soul and sharpen the edge he's lost over the past year. It's up to him to avoid liquor and his wayward buddies devoid of ambition. He, alone, can discipline himself to study his craft and get back in shape for a career that depends on it. As Ricky prepares for the rigors of auditioning, Bobby receives inside information about a major production of Hair being cast. As it happens, Ricky has dreamed of playing one of the lead roles in that show for more than half his life! He focuses as he never has before, and prepares with diligence to win the part. Loyal to the man he adores, Bobby chooses to put aside his own needs while awaiting the outcome of Ricky's efforts.

409644,4859308,Can You See God in This Picture?: A Letter to My Sons Making Sense of 25 Years as a Pastor,eng,"Growing up in the church often lacks the beauty and meaning that God envisioned. John King s ministry as a pastor and teacher spanned the years from 1969 to 1993. He and his family moved 17 times in those years, and pastored in five churches, once even moving several times while at the same church. Occasionally down to the last jar of peanut butter, faith played a real part in their spiritual journey. And then there were the children. With nary a negative word for the adults, Can You See God in This Picture? tells the story of what passion for God can accomplish, both constructively and destructively, and explores the angry and stupid things adults do in the church, which children see and remember. Written as a letter to his three sons, and with many personal admissions and anecdotes, this memoir has the potential to bless any whose faith has been tested, perhaps even destroyed, through church power struggles, theological bickering, political infighting, and all the other things that burn out even the good pastors and sometimes even force them out of the pulpit. Pastor King was known in Western Pennsylvania for his knowledge of Koine Greek and Classical Hebrew, having taught in Western PA Bible Institute in Butler, The Lighthouse Ministry in Washington, and Faith Seminary in Bethel Park, PA in the 1970 s. He also taught at the Charismatic Conference in 1979 at Duquesne University. He graduated from a four year ministerial program at Northeast Bible College, which is now Valley Forge Christian College, and later returned to complete a course of study for a B.S. in Bible. In 1982, he received a Master of Bible Theology from the International Bible Institute & Seminary. Currently retired from the pastorate, he develops computer software at a financial- services firm in Boston and lives with his wife in their townhouse in a nearby town. He occasionally speaks at area churches, including the one he regularly attends, and he still harbors the dream of someday perhaps returning to professional ministry.",[],3.0,208.0,3.0,2.33,0.11099793962899386,0.12011454458596121,0.09790151764965468,0.12493022581117692,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1138541459923429,0.09758459373804823,0.10788741353970771,0.11445710874083205,0.11393051929085386,0.07288808234586977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Someone once told thirteen year old Ellie Bridge that she should always listen to what her grandmother had to say, there was a lot of truth in it. Given that most of Gran's stories were war memories and refugee tales from her life in Port Albion, it was easy to just nod politely without really listening. That's what most people did. If she had listened though, she might have been better prepared for the incredible and terrifying events that were about to engulf Ellie and her family in the small, run down town of Bellingham.
Life in Bellingham was dull, and growing up with a ridiculously strict stepfather whose personal mission in life was to ensure that Ellie had no friends, no excitement and no life made it duller. With restrictions on facebook, no phone (at least not one that he knew of) and strict rules about who she was allowed to be friends with, meant that anything concerned with local myths, stories and Gran's memories was never going to the highest thing on Ellie's agenda.
So when her eleven year old brother Danny comes home excited one Hallowe'en claiming to have seen a UFO in the Bellingham Woods, Ellie dismisses it as nothing more than the overactive imagination of an irritating younger brother. But a chain of events has been initiated by Danny's claim that is at once both unstoppable and terrifying. Ellie, her friend Shresta and Danny soon find that far from being ordinary, uninteresting children in just another dull town, they are suddenly the focus of unwelcome interest from a brutal and profit hungry mining corporation, a group of religious zealots and a band of ideological fanatics.
They soon find themselves fleeing deep underground, encountering demon-like creatures, lost travellers, ancient towns and a bewildering array of technology that is far beyond the capability of any science that they have heard of. And as they struggle to keep themselves alive and find out just exactly why they are of so much interest and value to their pursuers, Ellie soon learns that everything comes back to those stories that Gran was so fond of telling.",[],1.0,312.0,1.0,2.0,0.1814007530397321,0.18377036232267782,0.159564536769466,0.15915142017654998,1.0,1.0,0.18244193669057038,0.15833917416768967,1.0,0.1359369670161992,0.1626120504092141,0.17515385922298124,1.0,0.13296686750039816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

151333,18220961,The British in Bengal 1756-1773: A Society in Transition Seen Through the Biography of a Rebel - William Bolts,eng,"In 1756, the Company became the principal political power in Bengal. This position would be strengthened after 1764 and was finally openly acknowledged and confirmed during the government of Warren Hastings between 1772 and 1785.
The British, however, were not newcomers on the Indian scene. They were either the servants of that great trading organization known as the East India Company or lived there under its protection. The East India Company had been trading in India ever since the seventeenth century and had started setting up their Calcutta settlement on the eve of the eighteenth century. The Company's settlements were governed by a President and his Council, almost always made up of servants with the greatest length of service and exercising a virtually absolute power over their subjects by virtue of a Royal Charter. This small community of merchants, trading for their masters in London as well as for their own good fortune, was the driving force behind the British rise to power in Bengal.
Whereas increased British power in Bengal significantly enhanced the prospects of profit for both the Company and its servants, it also presented them with increased administrative responsibility. The existing administrative structure of the Company was severely put under strain by the political developments in Bengal as well as by the reactions of its servants thereto, who were quick to perceive new prospects for personal gain.
It would not be long before the old administrative structure of the Company in India would be contested from within by its own servants. The call for reform was raised early indeed and the first sketches of plans for the better government of the British possessions in Bengal appeared even before a great credit crisis in 1772 threatened the Company's very existence and finally induced Government to propose what would become the Regulating Act of 1773.
The author of the book proposes a micro-historical approach to analyse this process by exploring the career of William Bolts. Bolts was a junior servant on the Company's Bengal establishment during this crucial period, whose entrepreneurial energy and skill soon gave him an importance in private trade rivalling that of his superiors in the service. Political power and importance in trade were closely connected under the Bengal circumstances of the time and Bolts' very success therefore put the old hierarchical administrative structure of the Company under strain. In trying to bring Bolts' stature in private trade back one in accordance with his position in the Company's service, the Governor and Council of Bengal first provoked Bolts' resistance to their orders before causing him to attack its members before the courts of justice in Calcutta. Exasperated by his defiance of their authority, they finally resorted to measures of doubtful legality to have him deported from the settlement and put him on a boat to Europe. Bolts, however, continued his fight in London where he managed to draw the attention of the public to what were then called ""India Affairs"" with his publications and his orchestration of the legal pursuit of Governor Verelst by his former Armenian agents before the London courts.
If the roles of individual characters in the process of the expansion of British power in Bengal has been highlighted in previous works, the present book provides a close inquest into their public and private motivations. It also shows that the issue of how Bengal, and later India, should be ruled was raised very early in the history of British dominance there. Bolts' views on the matter, exposed in his two voluminous ""Considerations on India Affairs"", proposed an alternative to the authoritarian bureaucracy that was being put into place by Hastings and his successors and by which India would be ruled until well into the twentieth century. This reality of the Raj caused Bolts' views and testimony to be stamped as self-interested or at times even as ""unbritish"". The present book shows that Bolts' career shows much of the strains and tensions to which British rule was subjected from within. Bolts analysed them with genuine insight and his views and ideas are of real interest to the reader taking an interest in ideas about Empire and the history of early British rule in India.",[],1.0,305.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.06648472500459704,0.07583955445076342,1.0,0.06627968909841193,0.06862903532457902,1.0,0.056647769819672664,0.06003266955542446,0.06322711790717032,0.06670061763351445,0.07261321416433301,0.07307358490697287,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK
The Amazing Spider-Man
1. To the extent that you cover a superhero origin story, I'd recommend focusing on things and approaches we haven't seen much of before. I think it would have helped to either spend less time covering the origin story or make it more different than Spider-Man 1. That said, I thought ASM's approach to the death of Uncle Ben was smoother and more thematically effective-when Peter has the opportunity to stop the robber, there's a plausible and immediate threat to bystanders. Peter declines and Ben gets killed seconds thereafter. This makes Peter's motivation for a life-changing decision (becoming a superhero) more plausible. In contrast, in Spider-Man 1, Peter gets torn up because he doesn't get involved in a relatively minor situation with a police officer present, with only a faint connection between Peter Parker letting the robber go and the robber killing a civilian.
1.1. Peter plays a more active role acquiring superpowers. He was only in the laboratory because he stole an ID and figured out how to thwart a keypad. I think the scene develops him more than just getting lucky at the science fair in Spider-Man 1. (Likewise, he makes his own webslingers instead of getting them from the spider-bite).
2. Beware the idiot ball - make sure there are believable consequences to actions. Peter Parker displayed his superpowers in public so many times that I think his classmates would have to be idiots not to notice something was amiss. (For example, the NBA-caliber dunk? Or breaking a goalpost with a football? Or lifting enormous Flash Thompson by the neck?) When characters make decisions, there should be consequences. For example, if the character is reckless with his powers, maybe other characters come closer to figuring out what's going on. Or at least start asking difficult questions.
3. Speaking of consequences, I thought the crane scene was kind of cute. (Peter saves a construction worker's kid and the construction worker later pulls in favors at the climax to help Spider-Man). It helps build a contrast between Spider-Man's decidedly limited means and, say, the lavishly-funded Avengers or X-Men. I think it's also a more subtle and effective way of showing he's more of an everyman hero than we saw in previous Spider-Man movies (e.g. subway passengers throwing themselves between Dr. Octopus and a crippled Spidey felt sort of hokey to me).

The Comics of Charles Schulzcollects new essays on the work of the creator of the immensely popular Peanutscomic strip. Despite Schulz's celebrity, few scholarly books on his work and career have been published. This collection serves as a foundation for future study not only of Charles Schulz (1922-2000) but, more broadly, of the understudied medium of newspaper comics.
Schulz's Peanutsran for a half century, during which time he drew the strip and its characters to express keen observations on postwar American life and culture. As Peanuts'popularity grew, Schulz had opportunities to shape the iconography, style, and philosophy of modern life in ways he never could have imagined when he began the strip in 1950. Edited by leading scholars Jared Gardner and Ian Gordon, this volume ranges over a spectrum of Schulz's accomplishments and influence, touching on everything from cartoon aesthetics to the marketing of global fast food. Philosophy, ethics, and cultural history all come into play. Indeed, the book even highlights Snoopy's global reach as American soft power.
As the broad interdisciplinary range of this volume makes clear, Peanutsoffers countless possibilities for study and analysis. From many perspectives--including childhood studies, ethnic studies, health and exercise studies, as well as sociology--The Comics of Charles Schulzoffers the most comprehensive and diverse study of the most influential cartoonist during the second half of the twentieth century.",[],6.0,234.0,6.0,2.33,0.09011867953015594,0.09354892797447131,0.08018172804536035,1.0,1.0,0.10005611415708403,0.10070292336955333,1.0,0.07329676138475705,0.09304169776995379,0.07611484773878094,1.0,0.08623632519090503,0.06209749225220142,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
332679,18131249,Boudicca,eng,"Brittania was the most recent, and westerly province of the Roman Empire. Mostly pacified, and stable. Secure under Roman rule.
In A.D. 61, King Prasutagus, of the Iceni, had died, leaving two daughters, and his widow, Boudicca, known later by the latin name of Boadicea. She now ruled as Queen of the Iceni. The kingdom, situated in East Anglia, had been a friendly client state, the Romans having agreed to some autonomy. This was about to change. While the Governor, General Suetonius Paulinus was away, fighting the Druids, and their affiliated tribesmen, in North Wales, Decianus Catus, the Procurator, had been left in charge. His extreme treatment of the Iceni, led to subjucation, and the rape of Boudicca's daughters, and, when she protested, the scourging and lashing of Boudicca herself. An atrocity that turned the Iceni into uproar, revolt, and a thirst for bloody revenge.
Boudicca, at the head of one hundred and thirty thousand, well armed, warriors, was now imposing the biggest threat to the Romans, since the slave revolt of Spartacus. With their forces split between England and Wales, the Romans faced, not only annihilation, but, being swept back into the sea.
The Roman cities of Camulodinum, Verulamium, and Londinium, lay before the warrior Queen. Her blood lust, even threatened to turn into longings of a different kind.
The Iceni had been joined by the Trinovantes, with their leader, Denophias, a shrewd, and calculating, man.
The Iceni, were also well served by their nobles, particularly, Cembanus. Also, the Iceni warrior, and, now, ex-sheepherder, Unatrax, so muscle bound, and a formidable wielder of the Iceni long sword, he became known as Unatrax the Strong.
Paulinus, and the Tribune, Julius Agricola, a Gaul, of merit, and the legionaries from the Fourteenth, and Twentieth Legions, tried their best to hurry back with all haste. The nearest legion to the uprising, was the Ninth Hispana, led by the young Legate, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, garrisoned at the fortress of Lindum. But, were his five thousand legionaries of the Ninth, plus auxiliaries, a match for Boudicca's one hundred and thirty thousand, revenge-seeking tribesmen, and their four hundred, scythed, Iceni war chariots?",[],2.0,161.0,1.0,2.33,1.0,1.0,0.09558734661614267,0.0687681156096271,0.10440261786315956,0.079968892614059,1.0,1.0,0.09827829495046017,0.06327253404525175,0.0880697873289501,0.09178162435303609,0.10511551535688875,0.10019286887834966,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

229690,11447990,Mrs. Nixon: A Novelist Imagines a Life,en-US,"Dazzlingly original, Ann Beattie's Mrs. Nixon is a riveting exploration of an elusive American icon and of the fiction writer's art.
Pat Nixon remains one of our most mysterious and intriguing public figures, the only modern First Lady who never wrote a memoir. Beattie, like many of her generation, dismissed Richard Nixon's wife: ""interchangeable with a Martian,"" she said. Decades later, she wonders what it must have been like to be married to such a spectacularly ambitious and catastrophically self-destructive man.
Drawing on a wealth of sources from Life magazine to accounts by Nixon's daughter and his doctor to The Haldeman Diaries and Jonathan Schell's The Time of Illusion, Beattie reconstructs dozens of scenes in an attempt to see the world from Mrs. Nixon's point of view. Like Stephen King's On Writing, this fascinating and intimate account offers readers a rare glimpse into the imagination of a writer.
Beattie, whose fiction Vanity Fair calls ""irony-laced reports from the front line of the baby boomers' war with themselves,"" packs insight and humor into her examination of the First Couple with whom boomers came of age. Mrs. Nixon is a startlingly compelling and revelatory work.","['638188', '10238101', '8105645', '2713623', '381442', '13395627', '11104065', '805601', '713816', '10706657', '321110', '430600', '2267903', '2216931', '9109649', '60046', '7016276']",177.0,304.0,61.0,2.41,0.11439584460709205,0.1149285766362841,0.1050022667019021,1.0,1.0,0.09956164841369905,0.12158150060343308,1.0,0.09825528544544854,0.09787305222365815,0.11008996583128884,1.0,0.11865055265644643,0.11153575190878912,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

231258,23610241,Life Enthusiasm,eng,"Discover Life Force Energy as a catalyst for transformation and a path to personal freedom!
Life Enthusiasm: A Path to Purpose Beyond Recovery details how life force energy can propel the most desperate addict down a path to freedom and meaning. Through the application of Universal Energy the author discovers his intuitive voice and transcends a four decade entrenchment in addictive behavior in just eighteen months.
The element that gives the story its unique voice while imbuing it with a mystical and adventurous tone is the employment of energetic treatments or transfers to treat addiction and anxiety.
The undeniable power of Universal Energy to amplify and enhance one's spiritual progression to a state of freedom is the step that many people who have been frozen by anxiety or dependent behaviors have been looking for.
The story includes the author's experience of other dimensions of existence, sound healing, distance healing and various energy modalities.
This is a true story of the author's rise from apathy, self-pity, and victimization to an addiction-free state of life purpose and sovereignty. A vision ignites and illuminates a buried passion that must find expression ultimately through an enthusiastic and abstinent voice. The tension builds until the author must face the greatest obstacle on his path; full acknowledgement and ownership of the core deceit that blocks the completion of his purpose. It is in the sacred space of common experience where author and reader meet that solutions to any problem may be discovered. The book's final chapter summarizes the main elements necessary for others to find the freedom they seek. Although not meant to substitute a protocol to replace 12-step programs, it can be the ""13th step"" many are looking for.",[],1.0,178.0,1.0,2.0,0.13995515181220836,0.1471880938693783,0.13216843612676135,1.0,1.0,0.13833813331866532,0.1525166372821265,1.0,0.1240728087652492,0.1289835121632519,0.12423558861925808,1.0,0.1412466491925197,0.10615322416598222,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Claiming to have discovered a series of lost paintings by Piero della Francesca in the small Tuscan city of Arezzo, the father's manuscript moves between Renaissance Italy and post-Revolutionary Russia. At its core is the relationship the father has with an ageing Russian emigre, a woman who claims to have nursed the poet, Osip Mandelstam, in his final days. She is haunted by the ghost of her murdered son and the traumas she experiences before escaping Russia at the beginning of World War II. This central story is mediated by the son's commentary.

In this penetrating and provocative study, Sika A. Dagbovie-Mullins adds a new dimension to this dialogue as she investigates the ways in which various mixed-race writers and public figures have redefined both OC blacknessOCO and OC whitenessOCO by invoking multiple racial identities.
aaa Focusing on several key novelsOCoNella LarsenOCOs Quicksand (1928), Lucinda RoyOCOs Lady Moses (1998), and Danzy SennaOCOs Caucasia (1998)OCoas well as memoirs by Obama, James McBride, and Rebecca Walker and the personae of singer Mariah Carey and actress Halle Berry, Dagbovie-Mullins challenges conventional claims about biracial identification with a concept she calls OC black-sentient mixed-race identity.OCO Whereas some multiracial organizations can diminish blackness by, for example, championing the inclusion of multiple-race options on census forms and similar documents, a black-sentient consciousness stresses a perception rooted in blacknessOCoOC a connection to a black consciousness, OCO writes the author, OC that does not overdetermine but still plays a large role in oneOCOs racial identification.OCO By examining the nuances of this concept through close readings of fiction, memoir, and the public images of mixed-race celebrities, Dagbovie-Mullins demonstrates how a OC black-sentient mixed-race identity reconciles the widening separation between black/white mixed race and blackness that has been encouraged by contemporary mixed-race politics and popular culture.OCO
aaa A book that promises to spark new debate and thoughtful reconsiderations of an especially timely topic, Crossing B(l)ack recognizes and investigates assertions of a black-centered mixed-race identity that does not divorce a premodern racial identity from a postmodern racial fluidity.

""20#6 AD. Following the discovery of the genuine Dead Sea Scrolls, women get to learn it's a tampered-with version of the Old Testament which was used to keep their foremothers in submission for nearly two millennia. Hilarity fails to ensue.
After a first, scorned, attempt at enforcing the female-friendly newfound teachings, the not-so-weaker gender ends up revolting and snatching the reins of the US administration from the callous hands of Patriarchy. Two novelties will be born out of their reforms towards a healthy and peaceful society: the Collar, an electronic device for suppressing violent impulses in men, and the Pool, the State-run dating service for women.
The first Anniversary of the Revolution is now only a few days away. As the head of the Department of Information, Lisa Fenrich is all too aware of the stakes for her government. What she's about to discover is that the holes she's been plugging were trifles compared to the one about to open under her feet.
Disgraced yet unbowed, she will set out on a quest to recover the last secret fragment of the Holy Scriptures. One that would spell the end of the age-old rift between men and women if revealed to the world, but that the Presidentess she so staunchly supports intends to tweak around for her political survival; and maybe more.",[],8.0,310.0,5.0,2.5,1.0,1.0,0.15201712465140532,0.14674808664043196,1.0,0.1394937689994634,0.1552527840021107,0.15566187779137883,0.15069258387602774,0.11160052378435588,0.14051070360813958,0.14593434272314734,1.0,0.12728751845254466,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Following the arrival of white men, it became a penal settlement, a mission station, a gold-mining town, and a farming center with a history of white comfort and black marginalization. In the late 20th century, it was also the subject of the first post-Mabo native title claim, bringing new hope--and controversy--to the area and its people.

103162,2574850,Coming Out Straight: Understanding and Healing Homosexuality,eng,"Richard Cohen, a former homosexual, now married with three children, struggled for most of his life with unwanted same-sex attractions. He tried desperately to find professionals who understood his condition and help him heal. Because ""it was so difficult to explain myself to therapists, who didn't have a clue,"" Cohen eventually became a psychotherapist and developed both a groundbreaking understanding of same-sex attractions and a comprehensive treatment plan for healing homosexuality. ""Coming Out Straight"" not only details Cohen's personal journey out of homosexuality but also recounts his experiences helping thousands of men, women and adolescents heal their gender identity. Recoginizing that the ""gay rights movement"" has done a great service in bringing the issue of homosexuality of the closet and into the light, Cohen points out that in the name of tolerance, society has now succumbed to acceptance. ""If we embrace someone's homosexuality as normal and natural, their potential for wholeness will remain dormant beneath their emotional wounds. It's not bad to have same-sex attractions, as they represent a drive to heal unmet love needs. However, acting upon them leads to frustration and pain."" 
In simple language, ""Coming Out Straight"" presents the basic causes of same-sex attractions, a clear model for recovery, and stories of individuals who made the change. The book has three parts: In Part I, the author shares his own story and the root causes of same-sex attractions. Part II presents a four-stage model of recovery and healing. Part III discusses the healing of homophobia by overcoming fear and hatred of homosexuality. 
While the book is meant to educate therapists, clergy, and other professionals, it also assists those who struggle with their own same-sex attractions as well as their loved ones. ""Coming Out Straight"" sets forth an easy to understand primer on homosexuality, both for family members and friends of homosexuals, as well as for the general public. It will open the door to a new, happier, and fulfilling heterosexual life.","['958263', '6324600', '10913101', '23208863', '25450997', '12393909', '18666404', '15871121', '10432892', '7422957', '22596955', '26234490', '11349877', '23306734', '17555771', '87564', '24379183', '22716439']",295.0,292.0,97.0,1.73,0.10151157616091902,0.10301535707866191,0.10346932061585523,1.0,1.0,0.10664238075667844,0.11106209920111883,1.0,0.10016456085377724,0.09979133620076674,0.10200066913669183,1.0,0.11223918829813233,0.08207835167230168,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

At the core of this tale is a love story that spans a lifetime, wrapped in a gritty, epic, real man's fantasy that anyone can sink his or her teeth into. It is a beacon of truth in an enslaved world suffering from moral relativism and willful ignorance in the presence of Knowledge.
For the mature fans of Harry Potter, A Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Elder Scrolls, Legend of Zelda, Guild Wars, World of Warcraft, Fable, and Dragon Age, The Tale of Onora follows the journey of a young orphan after his village is destroyed and he is forced to grow up in a dangerous world. As he navigates through different walks of life, he begins to uncover a conspiracy as to why his village was destroyed. Before he can put the pieces together, his fate is sealed by a terrible war. In the storm of chaos that follows, his actions turn him into a legendary hero. The more renowned he gets, the closer the source of evil is drawn to him. The more he fights for the truth, the more of an outlaw he becomes. In Book One, a boy at the brink of adulthood travels beyond the ruins of an ancient elven city, to The Crown of The World in the far north. It is there where he meets his father for the first time, in search of the answers and reasons his mother refuses to discuss. At the risk of his life, he learns that finding the truth requires knowing The Tale of Onora.","['18666404', '23208863', '20930730', '23306734', '25977648', '22524177', '25450997', '22596955', '26234490', '18269478', '18621241', '12088709', '20625356', '11292672', '18052174', '8691969']",518.0,107.0,103.0,1.51,0.26269303487601453,1.0,0.2049486040129829,0.25152459915368874,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.26480775703318254,0.20930098517990894,0.19392410946768215,0.21652015113298487,0.2503094473873266,0.24116350176096965,0.2373729043311378,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

For centuries, drawing the human figure has given artists the tools and vocabulary for creating paintings, sculpture, drawings, or prints-from Renaissance classical to contemporary expression. In addition to working from the model, the figure-drawing student needs instruction in anatomy, history, and conceptual approaches to drawing the human form; such instruction is often missing from life drawing classes due to time constraints. DRAWING FROM LIFE offers these elements, along with a tremendous selection of drawings that represent the broad range of approaches, techniques, and media for drawing from life. The chapters follow the natural development of a student's growth, from fundamental sketching and gesture drawing to creative expression and exploration. An entire chapter on drawing the figure in perspective offers information that is not available in comparable textbooks. Students begin with quick sketches and gesture drawings, giving them a non-threatening introduction on a level they can readily understand and master. The cohesive presentation of anatomy, including a chapter on the human head, helps students understand the human structure and its impact on visible form. The final section brings the concepts, vocabulary, and history presented in the earlier chapters to bear on contemporary use of the figure in art.",[],31.0,272.0,2.0,3.91,0.0734156521729152,0.07597618427703814,0.06778784154660394,1.0,1.0,0.07876766461111082,1.0,0.08522860675934775,0.07480673465284621,0.07330219668680547,0.062260689959143495,1.0,0.07761780368732975,0.04356435425446714,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

She had no choice in the matter--none of the girls did. Her mission was to give birth to and raise many children in devoted service to a shared husband.

In this gripping and eloquent book, Susan Ray Schmidt tells the story of growing up on the inside and of her ultimate escape with her children from an oppressive and violent life.

The assignment that awaits him: The army is meeting with its Capitol Hill paymasters for classified talks on a new, state-of-the-art sniper rifle for U.S. forces. But vital details about the weapon are leaking--straight from the Capitol and probably into the hands of unidentified foreign arms dealers. The prospect of any and every terrorist, mercenary, or dictator's militia getting their hands on the latest superior firepower is unthinkable. That's where Reacher comes in. His task: infiltrate the top-secret proceedings and smoke out the mole. His target: a quartet of high-powered Army political liaison officers--all of them fast-track women on their way to the top.

In Michael Symon's Live to Cook, Michael tells the amazing story of his whirlwind rise to fame by sharing the food and incredible recipes that have marked his route.
Michael is known for his easy, fresh food. He means it when he says that if a dish requires more than two pans to finish, he's not going to make it. Cooking what he calls ""heritage"" food-based on the recipes beloved by his Greek--Italian--Eastern European--American parents and the community in Cleveland-Michael draws on the flavors of traditional recipes to create sophisticated dishes, such as his Beef Cheek Pierogies with Wild Mushrooms and Horseradish, which came out of the pierogies that his grandpa made. Michael translates the influences of the diverse working-class neighborhood in which he grew up into dishes with Mediterranean ingredients, such as those in Olive Oil Poached Halibut with Fennel, Rosemary, and Garlic; Italian-style handmade pastas, like Linguini with Heirloom Tomato, Capers, Anchovies, and Chilies; and re-imagined Cleveland favorites, such as Mac and Cheese with Roasted Chicken, Goat Cheese, and Rosemary.
Part of Michael's irresistible allure on the Food Network comes from how much fun he has in the kitchen. To help readers gain confidence and have a good time, Michael Symon's Live to Cookhas advice for cooking like a pro, starting with basic instructions for how to correctly use techniques such as braising, poaching, and pickling. There's also information on how caramelizing vegetables and toasting spices can give dishes a greater depth of flavor-instead of a heavy, time-consuming stock-based sauce-and why the perfect finishing touch to most meat or fish dishes can be a savory hot vinaigrette instead.
With fantastic four-color photography throughout and tons of helpful ""Symon Says"" tips, Michael Symon's Live to Cookis bound to get anyone fired up about getting into the kitchen and cooking up something downright delicious.

469851,16164011,The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America,eng,"The Inconvenient Indian is at once a ""history"" and the complete subversion of a history -- in short, a critical and personal meditation that the remarkable Thomas King has conducted over the past 50 years about what it means to be ""Indian"" in North America.
Rich with dark and light, pain and magic, this book distills the insights gleaned from that meditation, weaving the curiously circular tale of the relationship between non-Natives and Natives in the centuries since the two first encountered each other. In the process, King refashions old stories about historical events and figures, takes a sideways look at film and pop culture, relates his own complex experiences with activism, and articulates a deep and revolutionary understanding of the cumulative effects of ever-shifting laws and treaties on Native peoples and lands.
This is a book both timeless and timely, burnished with anger but tempered by wit, and ultimately a hard-won offering of hope -- a sometimes inconvenient but nonetheless indispensable account for all of us, Indian and non-Indian alike, seeking to understand how we might tell a new story for the future.","['24876654', '14288198', '17890839', '23590716', '11994903', '22393044', '16057370', '23129964', '13414642', '19321954', '24694081', '7337483', '16057339', '4578640', '16027869', '292706', '23317767', '1148401']",2.0,288.0,2.0,4.1,0.11050706394155212,1.0,0.09011108652369298,1.0,0.12826929438295853,0.1205367002711273,1.0,1.0,0.0955163179095191,0.10766738500584348,0.09575980554879325,0.1120673087536118,0.09799310168245505,0.08427196386919852,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He hires a matchmaker, of course. What happens when the matchmaker doesn't want to help him? Well, that's when the fun begins...
Nicholas Stirling, Marquess of Trubridge, loves his life just as it is: dissolute, scandalous, and deuced good fun. His father, the Duke of Landsdowne is not amused, and when he cuts off Nicholas' trust fund, the fun-loving marquess is forced to find an alternate source of income--in other words, he has to marry an heiress.
Every new-money American heiress knows Lady Belinda Featherstone is the key to social acceptance. Once a new-money nobody herself, Belinda discovered first-hand how heartbreaking the game of love and matrimony could be after a reprobate British earl married her for her money. Now a respectable widow, Belinda has become England's most successful matchmaker, guiding young American heiresses through the hazards of the London season and helping them to find husbands worthy of them. To her mind, the Marquess of Trubridge is nothing but a fortune-hunting scoundrel and she has no intention of allowing him to charm his way into any American girl's heart, including her own.","['16065684', '17331380', '14296766', '17334153', '17331378', '15782195', '15704763', '17543256', '15781045', '17333645', '16065488', '15704654', '16007701', '16056420', '16130107', '14822924', '16032314', '15713735']",30.0,384.0,13.0,3.78,0.10481393548364192,0.10525722481800685,0.10335127587413018,0.09034959851319746,1.0,1.0,0.0971211892671392,0.1039922788096375,0.08380073977594465,0.09879554672472236,0.0965325581006191,1.0,1.0,0.08447884517947085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

252695,18763360,Attempting Normal,eng,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER
Marc Maron is ""a master of spinning humor out of anguish"" (Bookforum), even when that anguish is pretty clearly self-inflicted. In Attempting Normal, he threads together twenty-five stories from his life and near-death, from his first comedy road trips (with a fugitive junkie comic with a missing tooth) to his love affair with feral animals (his cat rescues are bloody epics) to his surprisingly moving tales of lust, heartbreak, and hope. The stories are united by Maron's thrilling storytelling style--intensely smart, disarmingly honest, and explosively funny. Together, they add up to a hilarious and moving tale of failing, flailing, and finding a way.

Death is just the beginning for Reese, and he is a man struggling to make sense of it all. None of the world's religions had the Afterlife right.

He grapples with why God made the world and what our role truly is, and seeks to answer the question, ""How do I live in the natural world while expressing the values of the supernatural?""
Philip writes, ""I have come to understand faith as the highest form of integrated encounter. Faith puts together, assembles, re-orders, accepting the entire world as God's handiwork. We live among clues, like rescuers sifting through pieces of stained glass shattered by a bomb, and only with a blueprint or some memory of original design can we begin to connect the shards, to assemble them into a pattern that makes sense of our world.
""Nature and supernature are not two separate worlds, but different expressions of the same reality. To encounter the world as a whole, we need a more supernatural awareness of the natural world.""
Yancey invites readers to join him on a journey of discovery. He challenges us to tune into ""rumors of another world,"" and connect the seen with the unseen. He promises that the grace-filled result will be a life of beauty, purpose, freedom, and faith.","['298679', '324614', '407222', '903912', '279368', '334224', '76804', '235387', '97798', '324805', '210235', '173499']",21.0,272.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.15018295614333216,1.0,0.20593509352040382,0.21013918223821343,1.0,0.19972643570305817,0.18514521459607494,0.1595441942973288,0.1682884139606566,0.1566187298496252,0.19794246983684421,0.21395697724936294,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

544905,13645227,Creating a Missional Culture: Equipping the Church for the Sake of the World,en-US,"Once upon a time, Moses had had enough. Exhausted by the challenge of leading the Israelites from slavery to the Promised Land, Moses cried out to God, ""What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? . . . If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me"" (Exodus 11:11, 15). If that sounds hauntingly familiar to you, you may be the senior pastor of a contemporary church. The burden of Christian leadership is becoming increasingly unbearable--demanding skills not native to the art of pastoring; demanding time that makes sabbath rest and even normal sleep patterns seem extravagant; demanding inhuman levels of efficiency, proficiency and even saintliness. No wonder pastors seem and even feel less human these days. No wonder they burn out or break down at an alarming rate; no wonder the church is missing the mark on its mission. InCreating a Missional Culture, JR Woodward offers a bold and surprisingly refreshing model for churches--not small adjustments around the periphery of a church's infrastructure but a radical revisioning of how a church ought to look, from its leadership structure to its mobilization of the laity. The end result looks surprisingly like the church that Jesus created and the apostles cultivated: a church not chasing the wind but rather going into the world and making disciples of Jesus.","['12989206', '18500018', '3012984', '283799', '98679', '151886', '1037862', '13418168', '7169353', '25110', '7969547', '98404', '283800', '1203204', '8548607']",126.0,224.0,24.0,4.09,1.0,1.0,0.06906878253794593,1.0,0.0896080144556346,0.09054643554249014,1.0,0.091174427511787,0.08580612844084769,0.07362467746828422,0.07066451033287553,0.0689252597311687,0.08422250603842744,0.07742797834297767,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In Northern California two successful CEOs are both indispensable to their growing companies' futures. Both are brilliant at the power game. But the difference between them is huge. One is a man, the other a woman. In this riveting novel, Danielle Steel explores what that means as she takes readers into the rarefied world of those at the pinnacle of international business and reveals the irrevocable choices they make, what drives them, and how others perceive them. The heady drug of power impacts everything they do.
POWER PLAY
Even though Harvard-educated Fiona Carson has proven herself under fire as CEO of National Technology Advancement, a multibillion-dollar high-tech company based in Palo Alto, California, she still has to meet the challenges of her world every day. Devoted single mother, world-class strategist, and tough negotiator, Fiona weighs every move she makes, and reserves any personal time for her children. Isolation and constant pressure are givens for her as a woman in a man's world.
Miles away in Marin County, Marshall Weston basks in the fruits of his achievements. At his side is his wife, Liz, the perfect corporate spouse, who has gladly sacrificed her own law career to raise their three children and support Marshall at every step. Smooth, shrewd, and irreproachable, Marshall is a model chief executive, and the power he wields only enhances his charisma and is his drug of choice. And to maintain his position, he harbors secrets that could destroy his life at any moment. His world is one of high risks.
Like many women in her position, Fiona has sacrificed her personal life for her career, while Marshall dances dangerously close to the edge and flirts with scandal every day. Both must face their own demons, and fight off those who are jealous of their success. Their lives as CEOs of major companies come at a high price. And just how high a price are they willing to pay? Who are they willing to sacrifice to stay on top? Those they love, or themselves?
Danielle Steel's gripping, emotionally layered novel explores the seductive and damaging nature of power. Success and greed, trust and deception, love and loss--all come to a head in this compelling drama of family, careers, infidelity, and the sacrifices some people make to hold on to power . . . or to let it go.

Additionally, contemporary examples of the magic circle at work in modern esoteric praxis are provided and discussed in light of the traditional approaches they exhibit.

Carson envisions a present-day interview with a seventh-century BC poet, and offers miniature lectures on topics as varied as orchids and Ovid.

Now Jeremy, the son of gentleman pirate James Malory, falls in love....When Danny, a young woman who grew up on the streets of London with no memory of her real family, is banished from her gang because she helped handsome rakehell Jeremy Malory steal back the jewels his friend lost in a card game, Danny demands that Jeremy give her a job. She is determined to become respectable in order to fulfill her dream of marrying and starting a family. Intrigued by her beauty and spunk, Jeremy hires Danny as his upstairs maid, although he wants her as his mistress.
Under the tutelage of Jeremy and his cousin Regina, Danny blossoms into a lady. Although she is drawn to Jeremy by passionate feelings she has never experienced before, she refuses to be anything more than a servant to him because she knows he is not the marrying kind. When Danny undergoes a Cinderella-like transformation and poses as Jeremy's new love in an attempt to help him avert a scandal, a few highly placed members of the ton remark on how familiar Danny looks. Now tongues are wagging, raising the question of her true identity, which threatens not only Danny's chances of capturing Jeremy's heart but her very life.

Then, one spring day, he finds himself thinking back to his summers with Joe, the crusty, magical old man who was the inspiration for his novel. Joe lived in a ramshackle house near an unused railroad line, where he cultivated a lush and almost jungle-like garden. At the time, Jay was a lonely, bored kid, and Joe adopted him and kept him spellbound with stories of his adventures, and the lore of the charms he used to help grow his flowers, vines and trees.
This strong wave of nostalgia drives Jay into his cellar, where he dusts off six bottles of Specials -- Joe's potent homemade fruit wine. The wine, it seems, has a life of its own, and once Jay breaks the wax seal around the neck of one bottle, his life is changed. A sudden epiphany leads to a permanent change, and he impulsively decides to buy an old farm in France that reminds him of Joe's long ago home.
Moving to the small town of Lansquenet in the French countryside, he begins to cultivate his garden and rebuild the run-down farm. Slowly he is welcomed by his colorful neighbors, including the secretive, strong-willed Marise, who lives on the farm next to his. When the sun goes down each night, he retires to a candelit room where he feverishly spins the lives of the villagers into a new novel. As the novel progresses, Joe begins to appear to him, gently coaxing Jay to embrace a life that feeds his soul, and to challenge the very foundation upon which he has built his life.","['401528', '538858', '306700', '1660831', '2265741', '513617', '2494990', '10224669', '7832816', '807044', '1016935', '10622660', '201227', '9708598', '906980', '7914930']",20.0,357.0,9.0,3.78,0.16411676446020124,0.16641957373609934,0.165221411243457,0.1578515306115372,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1436193534570429,0.1630995933135423,0.14808708501290133,0.163918583498674,1.0,0.17819790847070086,0.10162483361324778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

7466,29252,Paths to God: Living the Bhagavad Gita,en-US,"For centuries, readers have turned to the Bhagavad Gita for inspiration and guidance as they chart their own spiritual paths. As profound and powerful as this classic text has been for generations of seekers, integrating its lessons into the ordinary patterns of our lives can ultimately seem beyond our reach. Now, in a fascinating series of reflections, anecdotes, stories, and exercises, Ram Dass gives us a unique and accessible road map for experiencing divinity in everyday life. In the engaging, conversational style that has made his teachings so popular for decades, Ram Dass traces our journey of consciousness as it is reflected in one of Hinduism's most sacred texts. The Gita teaches a system of yogas, or ""paths for coming to union with God.""
In Paths to God, Ram Dass brings the heart of that system to light for a Western audience and translates the Gita's principles into the manual for living the yoga of contemporary life.
While being a guide to the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, Paths to Godis also a template for expanding our definition of ourselves and allowing us to appreciate a new level of meaning in our lives.","['369821', '425030', '784357', '91197', '35320', '594396', '139393', '274726', '810280', '840918', '398051', '139359', '370997', '18147363', '136581', '965907']",446.0,352.0,30.0,4.3,0.0845868197462702,0.0830488937114625,0.07206314774946004,1.0,1.0,0.0848531482388254,1.0,0.07797347014401854,0.07275052139063978,0.07379101775099672,0.07077012831346102,1.0,0.08102006469605733,0.04803131420278223,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Macey's life has been turned upside down. Her mother has left, her father is absent and her two best friends (her brother Seth and his girlfriend Willow) are MIA. On top of that Macey is being visited by ghosts who need her help to 'move on'. But as wild as all that sounds, it's all under Macey's control until a rakish, good-looking spirit called Nick turns up ... in her bedroom!
Nick's a spirit with spirit who insists he's not dead, he's astral travelling and has a message for Macey: someone is out to get her. Macey's biting wit has got her in trouble before, so she's not surprised but when the threatening notes start turning up, she's seriously shaken. Does someone want her dead?
It's all rather disturbing but she's finding it hard to focus on who could mean her harm with the annoyingly handsome surf god Finn turning up at the most inopportune times and a father with a rather large surprise of his own.
Is it a case of bad timing? Or are these things somehow connected?

A beautiful novel of pilgrimage, of fulfilling lifelong promises, of a talking coyote called James, of unlikely heroes and hundreds of papier-mache animals...
Eighty-two-year-old Etta has never seen the ocean. So early one morning she takes a rifle, some chocolate, and her best boots, and begins walking the 3,232 kilometers from rural Canada eastward to the coast.
Her husband Otto wakes to a note left on the kitchen table. I will try to remember to come back, Etta writes to him. Otto has seen the ocean, having crossed the Atlantic years ago to fight in a far-away war. He understands. But with Etta gone, the memories come crowding in and Otto struggles to keep them at bay.
Russell has spent his whole life trying to keep up with Otto and loving Etta from afar. Russell insists on finding Etta, wherever she's gone. Leaving his own farm will be the first act of defiance in his life.
As Etta walks further toward the ocean, accompanied by a coyote named James, the lines among memory, illusion, and reality blur. Rocking back and forth with the pull of the waves, Etta and Otto and Russell and Jamesmoves from the hot and dry present of a quiet Canadian farm to a dusty burnt past of hunger, war, passion, and hope; from trying to remember to trying to forget; and inspires each of its characters to visit the sites they've longed to see and say the things they've longed to say.

545358,1229922,Franklin and Winston: An Intimate Portrait of an Epic Friendship,en-US,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER
The most complete portrait ever drawn of the complex emotional connection between two of history's towering leaders
Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were the greatest leaders of ""the Greatest Generation."" In Franklin and Winston, Jon Meacham explores the fascinating relationship between the two men who piloted the free world to victory in World War II. It was a crucial friendship, and a unique one--a president and a prime minister spending enormous amounts of time together (113 days during the war) and exchanging nearly two thousand messages. Amid cocktails, cigarettes, and cigars, they met, often secretly, in places as far-flung as Washington, Hyde Park, Casablanca, and Teheran, talking to each other of war, politics, the burden of command, their health, their wives, and their children.
Born in the nineteenth century and molders of the twentieth and twenty-first, Roosevelt and Churchill had much in common. Sons of the elite, students of history, politicians of the first rank, they savored power. In their own time both men were underestimated, dismissed as arrogant, and faced skeptics and haters in their own nations--yet both magnificently rose to the central challenges of the twentieth century. Theirs was a kind of love story, with an emotional Churchill courting an elusive Roosevelt. The British prime minister, who rallied his nation in its darkest hour, standing alone against Adolf Hitler, was always somewhat insecure about his place in FDR's affections--which was the way Roosevelt wanted it. A man of secrets, FDR liked to keep people off balance, including his wife, Eleanor, his White House aides--and Winston Churchill.
Confronting tyranny and terror, Roosevelt and Churchill built a victorious alliance amid cataclysmic events and occasionally conflicting interests. Franklin and Winston is also the story of their marriages and their families, two clans caught up in the most sweeping global conflict in history.
Meacham's new sources--including unpublished letters of FDR' s great secret love, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, the papers of Pamela Churchill Harriman, and interviews with the few surviving people who were in FDR and Churchill's joint company--shed fresh light on the characters of both men as he engagingly chronicles the hours in which they decided the course of the struggle.
Hitler brought them together; later in the war, they drifted apart, but even in the autumn of their alliance, the pull of affection was always there. Charting the personal drama behind the discussions of strategy and statecraft, Meacham has written the definitive account of the most remarkable friendship of the modern age.

When Shelby Holt convinces a friend to work at Wildhorse Pass tourist ranch, she never imagines he will die there. The police say Michael's death was accidental, but Shelby doesn't believe it. Haunted by guilt, she puts her academic career on hold to investigate.
Just back from the Middle East, Chad Graham is guilt-ridden over Michael's death too. He poses as a ranch hand at Wildhorse Pass to investigate the woman claiming his cousin's death is suspicious. Were the police wrong? Or is Shelby hiding something?
Shelby knows she can't trust her heart, but when it comes to Chad, she can't trust her head either. He looks uncannily like Michael. Yet even as their distrust deepens, sensual attraction simmers between them. The closer Shelby and Chad get to answers--and to each other--the closer they get to danger...and to a killer who will stop at nothing to avoid discovery","['13629109', '18484699', '2678633', '16005574', '18682587', '2155272', '16116275', '15859585', '13119266', '26216618', '16185253', '17997782', '13550475', '18293472', '15784247', '13419281', '17834146']",6.0,268.0,3.0,3.71,1.0,0.06908703552657408,1.0,0.05244783922472175,0.09574583525502503,0.06043137382401693,0.07082126867583872,0.05643247159333946,0.09687348184382344,0.05561355382062201,1.0,0.09394569193000467,1.0,0.039719247351041514,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Khattak is still under scrutiny for his last case, so he's surprised when INSET, Canada's federal intelligence agency, calls him in on another potentially hot button issue. For months, INSET has been investigating a local terrorist cell which is planning an attack on New Year's Day. INSET had an informant, Mohsin Dar, undercover inside the cell. But now, just weeks before the attack, Mohsin has been murdered at the group's training camp deep in the woods.
INSET wants Khattak to give the appearance of investigating Mohsin's death, and then to bury the lead. They can't risk exposing their operation, or Mohsin's role in it. But Khattak used to know Mohsin, and he knows he can't just let this murder slide. So Khattak sends his partner, Detective Rachel Getty, undercover into the ultra-conservative mosque which houses the terrorist cell. As Rachel tentatively reaches out into the unfamiliar world of Islam, and begins developing relationships with the people of the mosque and the terrorist cell within it, the potential reasons for Mohsin's murder only seem to multiply, from the political and ideological to the intensely personal.

In this book series, the short stories comprising The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes have been amusingly illustrated using only Lego(r) brand minifigures and bricks. The illustrations recreate, through custom designed Lego models, the composition of the black and white drawings by Sidney Paget that accompanied the original publication of these adventures appearing in The Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. Paget's iconic illustrations are largely responsible for the popular image of Sherlock Holmes, including his deerstalker cap and Inverness cape, details never mentioned in the writings of Conan Doyle. This uniquely illustrated collection, which features some of the most famous and enjoyable cases investigated by Sherlock Holmes and his devoted friend and biographer Dr. John H.

Hollow Citydraws readers into a richly imagined world of telepathy and time loops, of sideshows and shapeshifters - a world populated with adult ""peculiars"", murderous wights, and a bizarre menagerie of uncanny animals. Like its predecessor, this second novel in the Peculiar Children series blends thrilling fantasy with never-before-published vintage photography to create a one-of-a-kind reading experience.","['16118166', '17412895', '7775755', '13112915', '16060716', '11861743', '16182308', '13409145', '17262584', '18050728', '17831316', '14061955', '13618440', '13063098', '12810834', '13638131', '24001095', '17061489']",1020.0,396.0,209.0,4.07,0.1384097214655506,1.0,0.10282076342754748,0.1409479347547627,0.1403506656345337,1.0,1.0,0.1367642374891582,0.11225565965034452,0.10372683579877018,0.10996537969985933,0.12648295386099354,0.12487735610180324,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

16266,28126924,20 Questions,eng,"For ten years they ran, hid, and cleaned light bulbs and switches to leave no trace of ever having lived wherever their running took them. For ten years Mary dragged her daughter with her, and for ten years Sam didn't ask her mom ""Why?""
Her first question wasn't ""Why?"" but instead: ""Did you kill anyone?""
Mary was happy not having to answer any questions for as long as she could because she always believed the truth would hurt more than the ten years of lies.
Mary realizes that the wall she built to protect her daughter was also standing tall and thick between them. Sam deserved to know why she did some of the crazy things she did, but Mary isn't ready to give up too much too soon.
When Sam was little they played a lot of games on their long road trips; a favorite was '20 Questions'. But now that she was older, the game was used to bring them closer. Sam starts asking questions following the rules of the game, and Mary has to answer with honesty and reservation.
As the questions are asked and answered, the wall Mary built starts to crumble and sheds a new light on the dark secrets she's managed to hide.
20 Questions is a story that unfolds in two parallel tales. The first is of Mary and Sam. The second is of Jack, the FBI's lead agent on the Whitney kidnapping case, as he befriends Patty Whitney, Mary's mother- in-law, friend, and accomplice.
Chapter 1
Every light bulb had to be removed, wiped down, or replaced with a clean one. I was done with the light bulbs, and almost done wiping down the door frames. I'd wipe the little knobs that hung from the chains to turn on the ceiling fans after that.
We owned four lamps, so I boxed two of them, and the other two I'd put in a garbage bag to drop off in a dumpster somewhere along the way. The bathroom light switches I had to do right before we left, and the toilet, tub, and clothes washer would each get doused in about a gallon of bleach.
I heard the whoosh and screech of the school bus's brakes, and I looked at the already wiped down wall clock in the kitchen; perfect timing.
""I'll call you later,"" I heard Sam yell out to someone who was probably still on the bus.
No you won't, I thought to myself, because I won't let you...
I heard the front door open quietly, but no more than ten seconds later it was slammed shut with such force it made the whole house rattle.
Sam stormed into the kitchen where I had finished wiping the door frames, and spat out, ""We're moving.""
It wasn't a question or even a statement; it was an accusation.
I put down the packing tape and looked up at the teen who had just stormed in, and whose eyes were throwing daggers at me.
""Yes we are. And I'm really sorry.""
Sam ignored my lame apology and picked up the backpack she had dropped on the way in.
""When?"" she spat out.
""As soon as you're packed.""
I watched my daughter leave the room without another word, and I really wished I could still turn these things into adventures, just like I did when she was little.
When Sam was little, I could make it sound like we were going out to do some exploring, or like we were off to conquer the world. I'd give her a stick to use as a wand, a ball cap for a crown, an umbrella that was both a sword and a shield, and sunglasses that were supposed to make her invisible. Now that she's older, and considering the way she just looked at me, I'd hesitate to let her carry even pretend weapons for fear she might want to use them against me.
It took Sam less than forty minutes to pack up the trunk she always travelled with. In theory, the trunk was filled with all of her worldly possessions, which obviously didn't amount to much.
Sam and I could have done the packing in our sleep; experience came with having to move every four to ten months.
While Sam was at school, I had loaded the van with the boxes I packed earlier in the morning.
I had already taped an envelope on the fridge with a note inside, and put enough cash in it to cover the remainder of our 6 month lease...",[],2.0,299.0,1.0,3.67,1.0,0.15875410927668884,0.14455541563877344,0.13967720149349785,1.0,1.0,0.14922108025932582,0.12830129850575522,0.15725705294584386,0.12580076405282645,0.15289390973876343,0.15262533756602004,1.0,0.09489410921581513,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The Glass Eyeis Jeannie's struggle to honor her father, her larger-than-life hero but also the man who named her after his daughter from a previous marriage, a daughter who died.
After his funeral, Jeannie spends the next decade in escalating mania, in and out of hospitals--increasingly obsessed with the other Jeanne. Obsession turns to investigation as Jeannie plumbs her childhood awareness of her dead half-sibling and hunts for clues into the mysterious circumstances of her death. It becomes a puzzle Jeannie feels she must solve to better understand herself and her father.
Jeannie Vanasco pulls us into her unraveling with such intimacy that her insanity becomes palpable, even logical.

The body does not respond unless the mind is in the mood. And the mood can depend on one anywhere, anytime, triggered by anyone - all that's required is the activation of pleasure principle. This is precisely what this volume proposes to do.
In The Pleasure Principle, editor G.Sampath brings together some of the finest contemporary fiction writers on a singular thematic platform: erotica. Naturally, the stories make for an exciting read - exciting in all senses of the world.
In this volume, you will read about what happens when online lust goes offline, when a perverse desire consumes the life of a middle-aged teacher, when two women discover their attraction for each other, or when the cleaning lady turns up without clothes on.
You will read about the six tapes of ancient gods, the amorous misadventures of a small-town youth, a nanny's encounter with a baker in a Croatian patisserie, a nine-year-old's accidental introduction to sex, and the unravelling of a repressed god-woman.
The stories are diverse in style, voice and treatment but they all have one thing in common - an authentic rendering of the emotional landscape of sex.
For all its physicality, sex is the realm where human beings are at their most vulnerable, or most violent, or most tender. The Pleasure principle is a bold attempt to explore the pleasures and torments of this realm.

In four previous novels, Jason Goodwin's Inspector Yashim, the eunuch detective, has led us through stylish, suspenseful, and colorful mysteries in the Istanbul of the Ottoman Empire. Now, in The Baklava Club, Yashim returns for his final adventure--and his most thrilling yet.
Three naive Italian liberals, exiled in Istanbul, have bungled their instructions to kill a Polish prince--instead, they've kidnapped him and absconded to an unused farmhouse. Little do they realize that their revolutionary cell has been penetrated by their enemies, who are passing along false orders under the code name La Piuma, the Feather.
It falls to Yashim to unravel all this--he's convinced that the prince is alive and that the Italians have hidden him somewhere. But there are just a few problems: He has no idea who La Piuma is, and he's in no mood to put up a fight--he's fallen in love! As he draws closer to the farmhouse and to the true identity of La Piuma, what Yashim discovers leaves him shocked and in the most dangerous situation of his career.
Goodwin has an eye for detail like no other, and in The Baklava Club he conjures Istanbul in all its glorious exoticism.

The war in the north is coming to an end, but more and more it seems neither brother, Arthur or Sebastian, will end as the true victor. The priest Luther rallies an army of Karak, his aims unclear. Further north, Cyric continues to proclaim himself a god, and his followers are many. Caught between two enemies, Darius and Jerico must stand together to prevent the destruction of everything they hold dear.
And the key to their victory might be someone sworn to kill them both.

Lucy is a fourteen-year-old girl brought up in a fanatical religious sect that aims to take over the whole world under a deity called 'the Magnifico'. Children born into the sect are raised in communes headed by 'Fathers'. For some unknown reason, Lucy and another child, Paul, do not live in a commune, but are strictly raised by so-called 'Aunt' Sarah in the ground-floor flat of the Father's private house. He lives upstairs, and a mystery tenant lives on the second floor.
Lucy's experience of life is limited to the ground-floor flat, prayer meetings and the Magnifico's school, where children are educated with the aim of infiltrating influential positions in the outside world, working as skivvies or breeding future followers of the Holy Cause. When she suffers humiliation at school assembly, her trust in the religion begins to collapse, and through two school friends she learns some of the secrets of the sect.
Her aim is to escape before she is sixteen, when she will either be compulsorily married to one of the Fathers in the name of the Magnifico, or disposed of as unsuitable to further the Holy Cause. She does not know whom to trust and wants to formulate an escape plan, but the matter is taken out of her hands when the Father's enemies invade his house and she has no choice but to flee...",[],3.0,313.0,2.0,4.0,0.21571032891027986,1.0,0.1772084392502286,0.16616110717553503,1.0,1.0,0.22277179659839413,0.16150459756035107,1.0,0.14998543959722807,0.20527842909998295,0.19570038124579597,0.21858149917320702,0.14799315635786342,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This imaginary Europe, Dipesh Chakrabarty argues, is built into the social sciences. The very idea of historicizing carries with it some peculiarly European assumptions about disenchanted space, secular time, and sovereignty. Measured against such mythical standards, capitalist transition in the third world has often seemed either incomplete or lacking. Provincializing Europeproposes that every case of transition to capitalism is a case of translation as well--a translation of existing worlds and their thought--categories into the categories and self-understandings of capitalist modernity. Now featuring a new preface in which Chakrabarty responds to his critics, this book globalizes European thought by exploring how it may be renewed both for and from the margins.","['160997', '307161', '75695', '357199', '181519', '149757', '187943', '1451718', '826055', '126241', '106024', '85924', '190465', '333544', '200142', '184044']",492.0,301.0,37.0,3.91,0.050961177727372804,1.0,0.043344883481314274,1.0,0.04886910151784105,1.0,1.0,0.05011556668826497,0.038033699531296546,0.04931751818880868,0.04804533681780273,0.04192428324166882,0.04549762568266091,0.03971838051802874,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Under Sejanus' iron fist, and unbeknownst to Tiberius, the ranks of the Senate and equites are subsequently purged of the Praetorian's enemies. Treason trials, once prohibited in Rome, have become commonplace as Sejanus relentlessly punishes any who would defy him in his quest for power.
After many years of commanding the cavalry of the Army of the Rhine, Tribune Aulus Nautius Cursor at last returns to Rome, amidst the turmoil. Two years later is elected as a Tribune of the Plebs; the representatives of the people who hold the power of veto over the Senate.

Duty bound to save the Empire from falling further under a tyrannical usurper, Cursor resolves to unravel the conspiracy and bring the perpetrators to justice.

Center stage in this turbulent saga, are the Wozniaks; a poor coal mining family struggling to achieve the elusive American dream. Confronted by the evil ways of their ruthless and depraved boss, Archibald Desmond Huxley, the Wozniak family is thrust into utter turmoil, thus igniting a blazing journey of revenge and survival.
During the Wozniaks' quest, the lavish lifestyle of Huxley and his fellow titans, including J.P. Morgan, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, Teddy Roosevelt, Mark Twain and others, are woven into the story line, thus painting a broad and vivid canvas of 19th century America. Springing to life are legendary figures and historic events that accurately depict an era boiling with bravado, innovation and astounding progress, yet blistering with corporate greed, class warfare, and political corruption. After many unexpected twists of fate (some fortuitous and others heartbreaking), the Wozniaks emerge victorious, thus finally achieving the American dream, yet not without scars.
Both powerful and poignant, ""A Blazing Gilded Age"" serves as an entertaining and enlightening read of how and why America has gone astray, and why it became a world leader. While on a personal level, it imparts the harrowing, yet triumphant, tale of a family's struggle to survive in an age that, in many ways, was as dark and rough as coal, and, at times, could be as blazing as Hell.","['13318705', '13641599', '21532747', '13511574', '13519812', '14761550', '13528385', '13452418', '833577', '13568862', '13166690', '13414576', '17968606', '13480207', '11737243', '15727066', '15734044', '12930742']",37.0,508.0,22.0,4.24,0.15860467841027664,1.0,0.13124296899793236,1.0,1.0,0.16499444073877423,0.1583271320506815,1.0,0.13969628146614035,0.12088889387783297,0.1254600995490969,0.13049064864633203,0.14630835268534578,0.12271006201101532,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Even centuries later, the final decades of the twentieth century are still regarded -- by those who know the truth of what really happened -- as one of the darkest and most perilous chapters in the history of humanity. Now, as an ancient and forbidden technology tempts mankind once more, Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprisemust probe deep into the secrets of the past, to discover the true origins of the dreaded Eugenics Wars -- and of perhaps the greatest foe he has ever faced. 
1974 A.D.An international consortium of the world's top scientists have conspired to create the Chrysalis Project, a top-secret experiment in human genetic engineering. The project's goal is nothing less than the creation of a new, artificially improved breed of men and women: smarter, faster, stronger than ordinary human beings, a super-race to take command of the entire planet. 
Gary Seven, an undercover operative for an advanced alien species, is alarmed by the project's objectives; he knows too well the apocalyptic consequences of genetic manipulation. With his trusted agents, Roberta Lincoln and the mysterious Isis, he will risk life and limb to uncover Chrysalis' insidious designs and neutralize the awesome threat that the Project poses to the future. 
But he may already be too late. One generation of super-humans has already been conceived.

With his father now dead, Partridge has assumed leadership of the Dome, one of the last few refuges from the ravaged wastelands of the outside world. At first, Partridge is intent on exposing his father's lies, taking down the rigid order of the Dome, and uniting its citizens with the disfigured Wretches on the outside. But from his new position of power, things are far more complex and potentially dangerous than he could have ever imagined. On the outside, a band of survivors faces a treacherous journey to Dome. Pressia carries with her the key to salvation. If she can get it to the Dome, the Wretches could one day be healed and everyone might be able to put the horrors of the past behind them. Bradwell, the revolutionary, cannot forgive so easily. Despite Pressia's pleas, he is determined to bring down the Dome and hold its citizens accountable for leaving the rest of the world to burn. El Capitan, the former rebel leader, wants to help Pressia save as many lives as possible--but he's struggling to reconcile his newfound compassion with his vicious past. As former allies become potential enemies, the fate of the world is more uncertain than ever. Will humanity fall to destruction?

308723,31742268,Never The Bride (Dilbury Village #1),eng,"Abbie Carter felt doomed as she clutched her bouquet and started walking up the aisle. Again. She felt like she was stuck in some kind of Groundhog Day wedding nightmare. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Eight dresses, most of them hideous, were already stuffed in her attic space. She had more bridesmaid dresses than relationships. Was she really that unlucky in love? She despaired of ever finding her soul mate and was convinced that if she packed away dress thirteen in her attic, she'd never get to wear the coveted white one and have her happy ever after.
That was until she locked eyes with one of the handsome ushers, whose wink turned her elegant and well-practiced glide up the aisle into a flailing Bambi-on-ice spectacle. Miller Davis was the first man in forever to make her heart skip a beat, as well as her legs turn to jelly. And, for once, her interest in a man didn't seem to be one-sided. It was just a shame that the Atlantic Ocean separated them. Abbie couldn't even make a relationship with her elderly fat pooch, Sumo, work, so what chance did she have with a permanent New Yorker? Her best friend, Georgie, told her to ignore the miles that separated her from Miller and to go for it, saying that true love knew no bounds.
Was Abbie fated to always be the bridesmaid, or would her wish for the perfect day with the man of her dreams ever come true?
While Never The Bride is a standalone story, it's the first in the Dilbury Village series of romantic comedy novels. All of them will be set in the quaint fictitious English hamlet in the Shropshire countryside, but feature a different village couples' story.
Warning, if you are of a sensitive disposition when it comes to toilet humour, then the Dilbury Village series may not be for you!

""There's a time, from when someone dies to when they magically pop up at the funeral or as a bag of ashes, that remains a black hole, invisible to civilians, and they're happy with that arrangement. My job covers that gap.""
At forty-four Tom Jokinen began to seriously question the secular funeral rites that are taking over the industry: is this really the way we want to say our final goodbyes? The question had such a hard grip on his Finnish soul that he decided to quit his job in order to become an apprentice undertaker. Curtainsis about what he found, from the mundane to the macabre. Among the things he learned: in cremation, the heart and head are the last parts to burn; purple lipstick looks best on a dead man; funeral directors have been known to dance during the service - out of sight of funeral goers, of course, and with the utmost respect for the dead. For anyone who's secretly wondered why they paid $2000 for a 5-lb bag of dust - or questioned whether that dust was really the person they loved - Curtainslifts the veil on the funeral industry in the 21st century.","['7675692', '1115', '413347', '5817934', '449935', '762311', '7277210', '267868', '844696', '2050827', '8027018', '337046', '762503', '6082265', '7521284', '207933', '17682']",34.0,288.0,8.0,3.63,1.0,0.15554295934064766,0.14579363795545916,0.13356616795093748,1.0,0.13838112851996542,0.15388442525414556,0.12226821382721716,1.0,0.11787822873041916,0.14697682506045,0.14600037622090956,1.0,0.09247294414081225,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

364667,255987,Foucault's Pendulum,en-US,"Foucault's Pendulum (original title: Il pendolo di Foucault) is a novel by Italian writer and philosopher Umberto Eco. It was first published in 1988; the translation into English by William Weaver appeared a year later.
Foucault's Pendulum is divided into ten segments represented by the ten Sefiroth. The novel is full of esoteric references to the Kabbalah. The title of the book refers to an actual pendulum designed by the French physicist Leon Foucault to demonstrate the rotation of the earth, which has symbolic significance within the novel.
Bored with their work, and after reading too many manuscripts about occult conspiracy theories, three vanity publisher employees (Belbo, Diotallevi and Casaubon) invent their own conspiracy for fun. They call this satirical intellectual game ""The Plan"", a hoax that connects the medieval Knights Templar with other occult groups from ancient to modern times. This produces a map indicating the geographical point from which all the powers of the earth can be controlled--a point located in Paris, France, at Foucault's Pendulum. But in a fateful turn the joke becomes all too real.
The three become increasingly obsessed with The Plan, and sometimes forget that it's just a game. Worse still, other conspiracy theorists learn about The Plan, and take it seriously. Belbo finds himself the target of a real secret society that believes he possesses the key to the lost treasure of the Knights Templar.
Orchestrating these and other diverse characters into his multilayered semiotic adventure, Eco has created a superb cerebral entertainment.","['530748', '3311228', '83169', '1719304', '572243', '107284', '333785', '913719', '94034', '9806', '826885', '984216', '7194', '1074893', '53064', '62567', '625094', '6662896']",1182.0,533.0,156.0,3.89,1.0,1.0,0.0734838589201528,0.06585737585614893,0.08094992703507516,1.0,1.0,0.07449091017948643,0.07280512196329852,0.054456487791847724,0.08139041223929885,0.07697339828987398,0.08319201330409631,0.06001274818496695,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

263608,162755,The Ernest Becker Reader,en-US,"Ernest Becker (1924-1974) was an astute observer of society and human behavior during America's turbulent 1960s and 1970s. Trained in social anthropology and driven by a transcending curiosity about human motivations, Becker doggedly pursued his basic research question, ""What makes people act the way they do?"" Dissatisfied with what he saw as narrowly fragmented methods in the contemporary social sciences and impelled by a belief that humankind more than ever needed a disciplined, rational, and empirically based understanding of itself, Becker slowly created a powerful interdisciplinary vision of the human sciences, one in which each discipline is rooted in a basic truth concerning the human condition. That truth became an integral part of Becker's emerging social science. Almost inadvertently, he outlined a perspective on human motivations that is perhaps the most broadly interdisciplinary to date. His perspective traverses not only the biological, psychological, and social sciences but also the humanities and educational, political, and religious studies.
Ernest Becker is best known for the books written in the last few years before his death from cancer, including the highly praised Pulitzer Prize-winning volume The Denial of Death(1974) and Escape from Evil(1975). These late works, however, were built on a distinguished body of earlier books, essays, and reviews. The power and strength of Becker's ideas are fully present in his early works, which underlie his later contributions and give direction for interpreting the development of his ideas.
Although Ernest Becker's life and career were cut short, his major writings have remained continually in print and have captured the interest of subsequent generations of readers. The Ernest Becker Readermakes available for the first time in one volume much of Becker's early work and thus places his later work in proper context. It is a major contribution to the ongoing interest in Becker's ideas.",[],27.0,248.0,1.0,4.37,0.08005051637185738,0.07809408524689214,0.06752692972764354,1.0,1.0,0.07091261897656367,1.0,0.07528301419631339,1.0,0.06423082128783698,0.06886709487412318,0.06794504008890037,0.07964959668867129,0.05194973734464446,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Otter Country follows Darlington's search through different landscapes, seasons, weather and light, as she tracks one of Britain's most elusive animals. During her journey, she meets otter experts, representatives of the Environment Agency, conservationists, ecologists, walkers, Henry Williamson's family, Gavin Maxwell's heir, zoo keepers, fishermen, scientists, hunters and poets. Above all she learns how to track and be around otters, and that the stillness required to actually see this shy animal can bring many unasked-for wonders.
Written in mesmerising prose, Otter Country establishes Darlington as a prominent voice in the new generation of British nature writers.",[],92.0,363.0,16.0,3.78,0.061352299437988096,1.0,0.05347411552832501,0.06751480992300626,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.058558800071404515,0.06597615906699429,0.05375441098765647,0.06342112916750194,0.06606170150927589,0.06621885409638477,0.045165230351533435,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
341744,71150,The Night Battles: Witchcraft & Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth & Seventeenth Centuries,en-US,"Based on research in the Inquisitorial archives, the book recounts the story of a peasant fertility cult centred on the benandanti. These men and women regarded themselves as professional anti-witches, who (in dream-like states) apparently fought ritual battles against witches and wizards, to protect their villages and harvests. If they won, the harvest would be good, if they lost, there would be famine. The inquisitors tried to fit them into their pre-existing images of the witches sabbat. The result of this cultural clash which lasted over a century, was the slow metamorphosis of the benandanti into their enemies the witches. Carlo Ginzburg shows clearly how this transformation of the popular notion of witchcraft was manipulated by the Inquisitors, and disseminated all over Europe and even to the New World. The peasants fragmented and confused testimony reaches us with great immediacy, enabling us to identify a level of popular belief which constitutes a valuable witness for the reconstruction of the peasant way of thinking of this age.","['73705', '835479', '201592', '804430', '314102', '1371899', '232143', '347038', '1085381', '652335', '45529', '712166', '712196', '333301', '40632', '198833', '1395784', '167530']",522.0,232.0,29.0,4.02,0.08880327320187285,1.0,0.06689180878143801,1.0,0.09241175466963335,0.09200650241919414,1.0,1.0,0.0853143633618532,0.07558188952636327,0.0706373745275808,0.0805186994558759,0.07509661388410267,0.08526593217485001,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In 1999, Juliette Wills had a bright future as a journalist and broadcaster. One minute she'd be in Melbourne or Monaco covering the Grand Prix, the next interviewing footballers and pop stars. She'd just moved to the seaside, made friends with a seagull (yes, really) and spent her weekends dancing in rockabilly clubs in London.
Just a year later she was suddenly struck down by three debilitating, incurable illnesses: ankylosing spondylitis, scoliosis and ulcerative colitis. After undergoing traumatic, life-saving surgery and in so much pain she was unable to walk, Juliette lost everything - her career, her relationship and finally, her independence. More recently, Juliette has also been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, another painful, incurable condition and more recently, Crohn's Disease, the news of which has devastated Juliette and her family.
Mostly Cloudy With Some Bright Spells is an incredible story of determination, acceptance, love - and above all else - hope.

174812,31686053,American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,en-US,"From 1999 to 2009, U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle recorded the most career sniper kills in United States military history. The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyles kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the astonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyle so much they named him al-Shaitan (""the devil"") and placed a bounty on his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs, Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadly accuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping and unforgettable, Kyle's masterful account of his extraordinary battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all time.
A native Texan who learned to shoot on childhood hunting trips with his father, Kyle was a champion saddle-bronc rider prior to joining the Navy. After 9/11, he was thrust onto the front lines of the War on Terror, and soon found his calling as a world-class sniper who performed best under fire. He recorded a personal-record 2,100-yard kill shot outside Baghdad; in Fallujah, Kyle braved heavy fire to rescue a group of Marines trapped on a street; in Ramadi, he stared down insurgents with his pistol in close combat. Kyle talks honestly about the pain of war--of twice being shot and experiencing the tragic deaths of two close friends.
American Sniper also honors Kyles fellow warriors, who raised hell on and off the battlefield. And in moving first-person accounts throughout, Kyles wife, Taya, speaks openly about the strains of war on their marriage and children, as well as on Chris.
Adrenaline-charged and deeply personal, American Sniper is a thrilling eyewitness account of war that only one man could tell.","['13513206', '13515711', '13153198', '12727472', '12990404', '15818527', '9739365', '115996', '727664', '13167092', '7338857', '12878300', '9755391', '55764', '147100', '9525402', '3008822', '15814872']",1806.0,499.0,24.0,3.97,1.0,1.0,0.11744642127767535,0.15264251078150054,0.1475831675856611,0.10550452315071371,0.12475546490548962,1.0,0.11200887852335611,0.10521403715141517,0.1102896700525528,0.11965238945368681,0.14027169401965853,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Bruno and Michel are half-brothers abandoned by their mother, an unabashed devotee of the drugged-out free-love world of the sixties. Bruno, the older, has become a raucously promiscuous hedonist himself, while Michel is an emotionally dead molecular biologist wholly immersed in the solitude of his work.

Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murry, as well as Huxley himself.","['126603', '16114', '188454', '778463', '11890', '188458', '126512', '777824', '259020', '127020', '771507', '261441', '127028', '59091', '13033', '30919', '52783', '91494']",22.0,514.0,6.0,3.85,1.0,0.11213776645134046,0.10629713376338029,1.0,1.0,0.0969832577969297,0.110530797427086,0.1030033158408986,0.10663324986987646,0.08946833194009558,0.10426609317932317,0.11328378415321254,1.0,0.07686143673668017,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Jerome was the name given to the nearly dead, legless stranger who washed up on a Digby Neck beach in 1863. During the next fifty years, Jerome spoke only a few words and never revealed his identity. Author Fraser Mooney Jr. embarked on a ten-year investigation to find the remarkable truth about Jerome. Using newspaper articles, historic documents, and interviews, Mooney explores and dispels the myths that have long been associated with Jerome and provides amazing detail about his life on Digby Neck. He takes us through Jerome's life-from his appearance on the beach, through the time he spent living with a number of families in the region, to his death. Most importantly, Mooney discovers the truth behind the identity of the anonymous, mutilated man who took his secret to the grave. Including photos of Jerome, the beach where he was discovered, and those who knew him, Jerome is an incredibly well researched, intriguing book that will appeal to readers who enjoy Maritime mysteries and historical non-fiction.

We fear that if people knew who we really are, we'd be disqualified from ministry. Not so. Mandy Smith unpacks the biblical paradox that God's strength is revealed through our human weakness. Transparently describing her pastoral journey, Smith shows how vulnerability shapes ministry, through our spiritual practices and relationships, influencing our preaching, teaching and even the nuts and bolts of the daily schedule. Understanding our human constraints makes our ministry more sustainable and guards us against disillusionment and burnout. We don't have to have it all together.

562820,16286326,Bloody Breathitt: Politics and Violence in the Appalachian South,eng,"The notorious conflict between the Hatfield and the McCoy families of West Virginia and Kentucky is often remembered as America's most famous feud, but it was relatively brief and subdued compared to the violence in Breathitt County, Kentucky. From the Reconstruction period until the early twentieth century, Breathitt's 500 square miles of rugged upcountry land was known as ""the darkest and bloodiest of all the dark and bloody feud counties"" due to its considerable number of homicides, which were not always related to the factional conflicts that swept the region.
In Bloody Breathitt, T. R. C. Hutton casts a critical eye on this territory for the first time. He carefully investigates instances of individual and mass violence in the county from the Civil War through the Progressive era, exploring links between specific incidents and broader national and regional events. Although the killings were typically portrayed as depoliticized occurrences, Hutton explains how their causes and implications often reflected distinctly political intentions. By framing the incidents as ""feuds,"" those in positions of authority disguised politically motivated murders by placing them in a fictive past, preventing outsiders from understanding the complex reality.
This meticulously researched volume offers the first comprehensive narrative of the violence in this infamous Kentucky county, examining Breathitt's brutal history and its significance to the state, the South, and the nation. While the United States has enjoyed unparalleled longevity as a republic, Hutton's timely study reminds readers that the nation's political stability has had a tremendous cost in terms of bloodshed.",[],9.0,430.0,2.0,4.3,1.0,0.06354798033909295,0.06587358989293822,1.0,0.06569740639090745,0.04066780240436595,0.05047328175356513,1.0,0.06283812819435598,0.049015449804518656,0.056964221662230016,0.04729675272146551,0.07133036436202912,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

407222,16130525,The Art of Negotiation: How to Improvise Agreement in a Chaotic World,en-US,"A member of the world renowned Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School introduces the powerful next-generation approach to negotiation.
For many years, two approaches to negotiation have prevailed: the 'win-win' method exemplified in Getting to Yesby Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton; and the hard-bargaining style of Herb Cohen's You Can Negotiate Anything. Now award-winning Harvard Business School Professor Michael Wheeler provides a dynamic alternative to one-size-fits-all strategies that don't match real world realities.
The Art of Negotiationshows how master negotiators thrive in the face of chaos and uncertainty. They don't trap themselves with rigid plans. Instead they understand negotiation as a process of exploration that demands on-going learning, adapting, and influencing. Their agility enables them to reach agreement when others would be stalemated.
Michael Wheeler illuminates the improvisational nature of negotiation, drawing on his own research and his work with Program on Negotiation colleagues. He explains how the best practices of diplomats such as George Mitchell, deal-maker Bruce Wasserstein, and Hollywood producer Gerry Weintraub apply to everyday transactions like selling a house, buying a car, or landing a new contract. Wheeler also draws lessons on agility and creativity from fields like jazz, sports, theater, and even military science.
The Art of Negotiationincludes preparation tools for setting stretch goals in negotiation, as well establishing when walking away from a deal is better than saying yes. The book also lays out nine principles for crafting resilient strategy, and techniques for maintaining emotional poise in tense situations. Effective negotiators are both calm and alert, patient and proactive.
Wheeler provides a comprehensive view of negotiation, from openings to closings, including critical moments along the way. For experienced practitioners, The Art of Negotiationprovides a new and powerful way to analyze and manage the process. For students and others new to negotiation, it offers a clear path for building success and confidence in this all-important arena.","['16158533', '18079531', '15811534', '17986400', '16087642', '9744816', '17718121', '5711989', '17079742', '19990883', '15854790', '440275', '17718187', '7099323']",162.0,320.0,12.0,3.89,1.0,1.0,0.07823682659365798,1.0,0.09157122204871004,1.0,0.09262166593249359,0.07660939757536123,0.08262808361336062,0.0806454744649453,0.08131775984834513,0.08112715214974146,0.08978831161278403,0.06492809243115939,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The Crazy Basketball Association,eng,"A top college basketball player for Oregon State and Purdue and a native of Indiana who believed he could one day play in the NBA, Carson Cunningham came close. Well - sort of close. He ended up in the minor leagues of professional basketball instead, in the storied and now defunct CBA, a league that has turned out a record-setting number of NBA players and coaches, such as Phil Jackson and George Karl. It wasn't glamorous, in fact the playing conditions in the CBA were pretty grim; near-empty arenas, interminable bus rides to nowheresville, oddball coaches, little loyalty from management, meager pay, these were a few realities of CBA life. And yet, even as it chipped away at your dignity and made little economic sense to remain, the CBA drew you in with the allure of action and the prospect of an NBA call-up. And it could inspire, like when you and your teammates caught a rhythm that made you remember why basketball is such a beautiful game, or when you saw guys continue to strive, to persevere, even if their dreams weren't fully realized.
Carson writes honestly, hilariously and often touchingly of his running and gunning days as a CBA also-ran, with flash backs to his college days where the future seemed brighter than a new pair of Nikes. A top recruit with superior ballhanding and shooting skills along with a sixth basketball sense, in 1997 Carson was a Sporting News All-American freshman who broke Gary Payton's freshman scoring record and a few years later helped his team at Purdue get within a game of the Final Four.","['75649', '284738', '379880', '13227880', '10836991', '25663871', '310287', '360981', '11788779', '827413', '9316548', '18079520', '1860104', '15793123', '25150543', '17303581', '36675']",2.0,232.0,1.0,3.93,0.07921443609695994,1.0,0.06681143488744828,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.07222478709481625,0.06648943016247275,0.06481331987044636,0.07015207846423381,0.062141086795671305,0.07617594246345173,0.07466897371662588,0.048422806122152294,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But a storm capsizes their boat, and despite Hugh's desperate efforts, he can't save his brother's life. Then he finds evidence amongst the wreckage of sabotage and realizes he was never meant to return to dock. Someone intending to murder the earl killed his younger brother, instead.

Luke is in New York on a mission: to get closure from the woman who once broke his heart. And if he gets to rattle her cage along the way, that's just a bonus.
But when a game of truth or dare reveals a simmering attraction, everything changes. Now Luke is determined to make Kali admit her desire for him...and she's just as determined to deny it.
In their battle of wills, love is the last thing they expect to find--and the only game both of them can win.
His One Desire is a steamy romance novella of 24,000 words.
EXCERPT
""I dare you to sit without moving or speaking for ten minutes.""
Kali sat back in surprise. ""That's it?"" She thought about it for a moment. ""I suppose that's your snide way of telling me I talk too much. Well, fine."" She turned to face the speaker at the front of the room, her arms folded and a sour expression on her face.
Under the cover of the tablecloth, Luke put his hand on her thigh.
She jerked away in outrage, only just stopping herself from saying something out loud.
Did he think he could win the game that easily? Well, she was made of tougher stuff than he realized. She wasn't an innocent schoolgirl now, who could be overwhelmed by a simple touch.
His eyes met hers as he found her leg again.
The big hand circling her thigh was blatantly possessive. When she tried to pull away he gripped her harder, tighter.
And then, finally, she understood.
This was the dare. She had to sit here for ten minutes while he...what? Exactly how far was he planning to take this?
Luke seemed cool and detached, his blue eyes giving nothing away. His face had never looked more handsome or more remote.
Then his fingers moved again, softly, massaging the muscles just above her knee.
And one corner of his mouth rose half an inch.","['15851347', '9637607', '20898417', '13449081', '16078076', '8431279', '9272829', '29566096', '24248421', '17698339', '6487580', '17207163', '22822556', '6621165', '18628580', '17569179', '29209041']",513.0,77.0,41.0,3.66,1.0,0.13821737470831427,0.13026880223872625,0.11333429217099635,1.0,0.134450494846577,0.13656641022844737,0.10650339952878411,0.13150885053091965,0.11835202316073655,0.12877369903898542,1.0,1.0,0.0869129427320757,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

255414,19543156,The Unlikely Hero of Room 13B,eng,"Deep, understated, and wise, this engaging YA novel, winner of the Governor General's Award in Canada, is about more than the tough issue of teens dealing with obsessive-compulsive order. It also has romance, and a whodunit element that will keep readers guessing. Perfect for readers who love Eleanor & Park!
Adam Spencer Ross is almost fifteen, and he's got his hands full confronting the problems that come with having divorced parents and new stepsiblings. Add to that his obsessive-compulsive disorder and it's just about impossible for him to imagine ever falling in love. Adam's life changes, however, the instant he meets Robyn Plummer: he is hopelessly, desperately drawn to her. But is it possible to have a normal relationship when your life is anything but?
Filled with moments of deep emotion and unexpected humor, The Unlikely Hero of Room 13B explores the complexities of living with OCD and offers the prospect of hope, happiness, and healing.","['13330305', '21490991', '17159033', '22747842', '20344687', '17696790', '23388164', '13628605', '18139007', '18222731', '25982606', '25809985', '9452732', '17160013', '20517379', '18209406', '14431470', '23271669']",358.0,291.0,107.0,3.89,0.08995984830785017,0.09323762912907078,0.07924985047535664,0.0870176365744882,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.09291739531367693,0.06949863705384415,0.08968607525957348,0.07692706149662268,1.0,0.08858505905717526,0.06194580180699151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

490361,11296327,Body and Soul: The Black Panther Party and the Fight Against Medical Discrimination,eng,"Between its founding in 1966 and its formal end in 1980, the Black Panther Party blazed a distinctive trail in American political culture. The Black Panthers are most often remembered for their revolutionary rhetoric and militant action. Here Alondra Nelson deftly recovers an indispensable but lesser-known aspect of the organization's broader struggle for social justice: health care. The Black Panther Party's health activism--its network of free health clinics, its campaign to raise awareness about genetic disease, and its challenges to medical discrimination--was an expression of its founding political philosophy and also a recognition that poor blacks were both underserved by mainstream medicine and overexposed to its harms.
Drawing on extensive historical research as well as interviews with former members of the Black Panther Party, Nelson argues that the Party's focus on health care was both practical and ideological. Building on a long tradition of medical self-sufficiency among African Americans, the Panthers' People's Free Medical Clinics administered basic preventive care, tested for lead poisoning and hypertension, and helped with housing, employment, and social services. In 1971, the party launched a campaign to address sickle-cell anemia. In addition to establishing screening programs and educational outreach efforts, it exposed the racial biases of the medical system that had largely ignored sickle-cell anemia, a disease that predominantly affected people of African descent.
The Black Panther Party's understanding of health as a basic human right and its engagement with the social implications of genetics anticipated current debates about the politics of health and race. That legacy--and that struggle--continues today in the commitment of health activists and the fight for universal health care.","['850104', '794664', '15722514', '211873', '1642566', '629395', '12026754', '139611', '200142', '388974', '406174', '183680', '1615117', '1006784', '18210783', '90528', '17072350', '1029925']",127.0,289.0,13.0,4.29,1.0,0.06044828941996137,0.054559468769490437,1.0,0.06579792686412034,0.04314677074271351,0.05358327272229258,1.0,1.0,0.0510429383972185,0.058610778745329654,0.050982544270059854,0.0635365278272473,0.04546614209297721,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

414154,18809069,White Bees,en-US,"They stare at her. Point at her face. Shout laughter encased in cruel laughter toward her. Yet, despite it all, Amy shines beautiful. In this heartfelt memoir Amy endures multiple surgeries for her bilateral cleft lip and palate--including a grueling cranial facial surgery at age sixteen just as her older sister Jeannie, a model, competes in a national pageant. When she reaches her private breaking point as the girls around her start to date, she prays just one boy will see past her face of scars and into her heart--and chose her. What happens next shocks the entire student body, and has all of the girls wishing they could trade her places. A sample of Chapter 1: My mother has loved me from the very start. I must have felt her faith as she took me in her arms the day I was born and looked upon my tangled face and into my new blue eyes with courage and complete understanding, knowing the road ahead would be laced with trials and mixed with grace. High school wasn't supposed to start this way. The same way all of my other school years had started--wearing my same face that brought the painful responses I pretended not to see. Above my basement bedroom, I heard Mom opening and shutting cupboard doors, the weight of her feet flexing the creaky floor in the rhythm of a new morning. I turned my head and inhaled the honest scent of my pillowcase, the fibers holding traces of salt water from nights I carried my burden alone. Not everyone stared at me with critical eyes. Mom stared right into my heart, my being, my soul. She didn't ask if I was being teased or if I wished I were perfect. I'm not even sure the idea crossed her mind. Instead, she told me I was confident and beautiful, with way more friends than she'd ever had. She said I amazed her. And I believed her. I pulled my right leg to my chest and hugged my knee, then dropped my hand to trace the inch-long scar on the inside of my ankle from an IV I'd had as a new baby. Mom couldn't remember which surgery caused the scar. But she'd said it had started as a small pierce from a needle and, once healed, had stretched as I'd grown. For some reason moving my finger back and forth over the raised scar brought me peace. My younger sister stirred in her twin bed four feet from mine. She lobbed one arm up and out from under the covers and onto the nightstand where her thick glasses rested. With the other hand, she cleared the tangled hair away from her face. She situated the glasses on her nose and asked, ""Is it already time to get up?"" I leaned up on one elbow, looking past her silhouette to our bedroom window. ""Yup, it's morning, Toots, even though it's still dark outside. Jeannie is already up. I call the shower next."" ""What's that sound?"" ""That squeaky sound?"" ""Mmm hmm."" ""Just Mr. Sorensen. You know, letting his dog, Max, out to pee. His gate squeaks."" ""Oh. How'd you know that?"" ""I've been paying attention all summer. Listen. In a minute you'll hear it again when he goes back inside. I've memorized the whole process."" Jeannie, older than me by eighteen months, threw open the door connecting our two rooms. ""Hey, I lost the back to one of my pink triangle earrings. Do either of you have a pencil eraser I can use?"" ""I do,"" Toots said. ""But don't use my favorite pencil. Just use one of the regular orange ones over there on my desk."" ""I only need half. Thanks, Toots. You're a lifesaver."" I released my hand from my ankle, stretched both legs down to the end of my bed, then pointed my toes until my feet arched and my calf muscles burned. I'd waited fifteen years to be transformed into beautiful. The ""big"" surgery, the cranial facial surgery I'd been waiting for, was supposed to have happened before I started high school. Instead, it hung on the horizon teasing me with time until the bone in my face matured. The surgery was partly for me, but mostly for the people who had to look at me.",[],62.0,370.0,20.0,3.76,0.18526748128347265,0.18465209553321532,0.16798060435770656,0.15878267884799074,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.14020426279707446,1.0,0.15812630665327687,0.17227114578700164,0.19047306823513976,0.19108845697740115,0.10489950629138153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A conflict we will never see.
One woman stands between those determined to control history and those who will risk their lives for freedom.
Maya is hiding in plain sight in London. The twenty-six-year-old has abandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and chosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of people who call themselves Harlequins--a fierce group of warriors willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.
Gabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and have for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who may have inherited their father's gifts, have always protected themselves by living ""off the Grid""--that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks that monitor people in our modern society.
Summoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. The Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the Tabula--ruthless mercenaries who have hunted Travelers for generations. This group is determined to inflict order on the world by controlling it, and they view Travelers as an intolerable threat. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly pulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle looms--one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael Corrigan but also a secret history of our time.
Moving from the back alleys of Prague to the heart of Los Angeles, from the high deserts of Arizona to a guarded research facility in New York, The Traveler explores a parallel world that exists alongside our own. John Twelve Hawks's stunningly suspenseful debut is an international publishing sensation that marks the arrival of a major new talent.

555854,235730,The Sea and the Mirror,eng,"Written in the midst of World War II after its author emigrated to America, ""The Sea and the Mirror"" is not merely a great poem but ranks as one of the most profound interpretations of Shakespeare's final play in the twentieth century. As W. H. Auden told friends, it is ""really about the Christian conception of art"" and it is ""my Ars Poetica, in the same way I believe The Tempestto be Shakespeare's."" This is the first critical edition. Arthur Kirsch's introduction and notes make the poem newly accessible to readers of Auden, readers of Shakespeare, and all those interested in the relation of life and literature--those two classic themes alluded to in its title.
The poem begins in a theater after a performance of The Tempesthas ended. It includes a moving speech in verse by Prospero bidding farewell to Ariel, a section in which the supporting characters speak in a dazzling variety of verse forms about their experiences on the island, and an extravagantly inventive section in prose that sees the uncivilized Caliban address the audience on art--an unalloyed example of what Auden's friend Oliver Sachs has called his ""wild, extraordinary and demonic imagination.""
Besides annotating Auden's allusions and sources (in notes after the text), Kirsch provides extensive quotations from his manuscript drafts, permitting the reader to follow the poem's genesis in Auden's imagination. This book, which incorporates for the first time previously ignored corrections that Auden made on the galleys of the first edition, also provides an unusual opportunity to see the effect of one literary genius upon another.","['479035', '303488', '375365', '2840020', '1523984', '281747', '841116', '18459913', '108636', '730163', '375488', '18475503', '993792', '990264', '79903', '44829', '591705', '375149']",136.0,106.0,14.0,4.21,0.11709232815768147,1.0,0.0982275045696026,1.0,0.12655124166190063,0.11912186886749086,1.0,1.0,0.0999562102698656,0.10701351862418504,0.10137422322464626,0.11791963801478193,0.10674036966085756,0.12273206142763045,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Many people assume that effective sales ability demands a unique personality and an aggressive attitude. It's not true, and Robert Herjavec is proof. Known as the ""Nice Shark"" on the ABC's Emmy Award-winning hit show SHARK TANK, Robert Herjavec is loved by viewers, who respond to his affable nature. He has developed an honest and genuine approach to life and selling that has set him apart from his cut-throat colleagues, and rewarded him with a degree of wealth measured in hundreds of millions of dollars.
In You Don't Have to Be a Shark, Robert transcends pure sales technique and teaches ""non-business people"" what they need to know in order to sell themselves successfully. We are each our own greatest asset, and in order to achieve our goals, we need to be able to communicate with others, position ourselves and even look the part. Robert's philosophy is simple: Great salespeople are made, not born, and no one achieves success in life without knowing how to sell. Entertaining, enlightening and effective, You Don't Have to Be a Shark will reveal the secrets of one of North America's most successful businessmen, who also happens to be one of today's most prominent TV personalities, delivered in a friendly, down-to-earth manner, and filled with anecdotes and observations to support its hard-nosed advice.","['23245630', '26114480', '26114517', '9895682', '17235300', '26114505', '13274172', '23014803', '12661582', '13538833', '7661280', '21416295', '17566625', '25663928', '23167775']",205.0,288.0,25.0,3.68,1.0,1.0,0.1553349472139654,1.0,1.0,0.15484257510414948,0.16707061596710432,0.1570856921808659,0.15688761056118766,0.14515202536912264,0.1470874586010023,0.1523484117998834,0.1744807071700337,0.12680571111427547,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My son and I learned things about Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Nigeria and Oman. I think the section on languages is a great way for children to be introduced to foreign languages. My son loved the sound of foreign words and adores the characters. Very good book to teach children about different cultures, languages and places.'
'As a primary school teacher I think the Amara Para books are excellent tools for teaching children not only about the world but about languages and diversity.'
'This book is very cleverly written. The content and the illustrations are well thought out to have the maximum impact on the young reader. Very educational and colourful. My children have me reading them every night and then ask me thousands of questions about the different characters and the countries they come from.'","['18749082', '17880229', '13169679', '12924149', '15901406', '15864509', '17423086', '14437554', '16144196', '17165291', '17855868', '18210581', '17915373', '13414890']",2.0,32.0,1.0,4.5,0.1388791706446575,1.0,0.10900725332413216,0.14527206590768668,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.11972105159967215,0.1333509378517629,0.11074655141412112,0.11827765329647774,0.1389817165347887,0.13238136821949442,0.11217715925867444,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Joe Goldberg is no stranger to hiding bodies. In the past ten years, this thirty-something has buried four of them, collateral damage in his quest for love. Now he's heading west to Los Angeles, the city of second chances, determined to put his past behind him.
In Hollywood, Joe blends in effortlessly with the other young upstarts. He eats guac, works in a bookstore, and flirts with a journalist neighbor. But while others seem fixated on their own reflections, Joe can't stop looking over his shoulder. The problem with hidden bodies is that they don't always stay that way. They re-emerge, like dark thoughts, multiplying and threatening to destroy what Joe wants most: true love. And when he finds it in a darkened room in Soho House, he's more desperate than ever to keep his secrets buried. He doesn't want to hurt his new girlfriend--he wants to be with her forever.

There is only my word for it, granted, but I have several new Glass stories coming along ? waxing, dilating ? each in its own way, but I suspect the less said about them, in mixed company, the better.

If the past is prologue, then George R. R. Martin's masterwork--the most inventive and entertaining fantasy saga of our time--warrants one hell of an introduction. At long last, it has arrived with The World of Ice and Fire.
This lavishly illustrated volume is a comprehensive history of the Seven Kingdoms, providing vividly constructed accounts of the epic battles, bitter rivalries, and daring rebellions that lead to the events of A Song of Ice and Fire and HBO's Game of Thrones. In a collaboration that's been years in the making, Martin has teamed with Elio M. Garcia, Jr., and Linda Antonsson, the founders of the renowned fan site Westeros.org--perhaps the only people who know this world almost as well as its visionary creator.
Collected here is all the accumulated knowledge, scholarly speculation, and inherited folk tales of maesters and septons, maegi and singers. It is a chronicle which stretches from the Dawn Age to the Age of Heroes; from the Coming of the First Men to the arrival of Aegon the Conqueror; from Aegon's establishment of the Iron Throne to Robert's Rebellion and the fall of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, which has set into motion the ""present-day"" struggles of the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, and Targaryens. The definitive companion piece to George R. R. Martin's dazzlingly conceived universe, The World of Ice and Fire is indeed proof that the pen is mightier than a storm of swords.","['2029361', '18249394', '20980941', '14553832', '23847904', '13033955', '13329738', '13536349', '16098764', '77563', '16084419', '690949', '17151982', '18490602', '7346', '22934483', '18196045', '23168762']",792.0,326.0,72.0,4.26,0.13461464458251876,1.0,0.09613772144272505,1.0,0.1228150443178688,0.12441819519033695,1.0,1.0,0.10607362056341398,0.11395659444389189,0.09968926333092,0.10079816112927192,0.1161246748254384,0.12271318966899876,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Whether depicting a husband who finds his wife utterly transformed, a child who becomes a case study in wildness, or a road trip overwhelmed by buried phobias, Hall is always deeply attuned to the uncanny strangeness that underlies our everyday reality. In these memorable scenes, she delights in the mythic symbolism of wilderness and wasteland, and revels in blurring thresholds between the natural and urban, mundane and surreal, human and animal.
This is a haunting collection from a uniquely fertile imagination, written in lyrical prose glittering with the compacted power and striking imagery of poetry. Marked by Hall's characteristic fascination with the intimacy of nature - and the nature of intimacy - these intensely sensual, thrillingly inventive tales seek to expose our innermost fears and desires.

72948,6626721,The Gift of Thanks: The Roots and Rituals of Gratitude,en-US,"Known as an 'anthropologist of everyday life,' Margaret Visser has, in five award-winning books, uncovered and illuminated the intriguing and unexpected meanings of everyday objects and habits. Now she turns her keen eye to another custom so frequently encountered that it often escapes notice: saying 'Thank you.' What do we really mean by these two simple words?
This fascinating inquiry into all aspects of gratitude ranges from the unusual determination with which parents teach their children to thank, to the difference between speaking the words and feeling them, to the ways different cultures handle the complex matters of giving, receiving, and returning favors and presents. Visser illuminates the fundamental opposition in our own culture between gift-giving and commodity exchange, and the similarities between gratitude and its opposite, vengefulness. The Gift of Thanks considers cultural history, including the modern battle of social scientists to pin down the notion of thankfulness and account for it, and the newly awakened scientific interest in the biological and evolutionary roots of emotions.
With her engaging combination of curiosity and erudition, Visser once again reveals the extraordinary in the everyday.","['2773518', '13707570', '11392050', '10578451', '7277210', '7177621', '338211', '1902912', '6593355', '4641560', '53253', '1973949', '18167391', '8723098', '3254114', '9586820', '79941']",65.0,464.0,19.0,3.54,0.059652708425827816,0.06442289636206812,0.05486528755309311,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.06607976410583713,1.0,0.051607582040897125,0.0526406103293952,0.05079087741887364,0.06637977032336799,0.05857486305323197,0.044750609524664704,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But when a series of escalating temporal incursions threatens to open a new front of the history-spanning Temporal Cold War in the twenty-fourth century, Agents Lucsly and Dulmur will need all their investigative skill and unbending determination to stop those who wish to rewrite the past for their own advantage, and to keep the present and the future from devolving into the kind of chaos they really, really hate.","['10256068', '13270564', '131614', '3926165', '8323199', '6151033', '217901', '217951', '7242448', '9079213', '13547437']",16.0,353.0,4.0,3.98,1.0,1.0,0.08580961692025592,0.08841542934939645,0.09325266033482953,0.09546116002452358,1.0,0.09237386092699426,0.08900519735640146,0.06961129198754132,0.08812919376525931,0.08214247829383726,1.0,0.0879428031904533,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Inspired by Actual Events
Excerpt from the Journal of Clayton Stone - 1692
She was examined today without torture at Shadow Cove township on the charge of witchcraft. She said she was wholly innocent of the crime and has never in life renounced God. I watched as they brought her out. A poor, sickly thing, worn by her time behind the walls of her prison. Her bared feet and hands bound in leather, her clothing tattered to that of ruin. Despite such condition, her head was held high, her eyes meeting those of her accusers. She still refuses to provide her name so we remain unable to search baptismal records, nor has her family stepped forward to claim her as their own. We have no reason to believe she is anything but an orphaned child. I find myself unable to look at her directly in the moments preceding her trial. She is watching me though; with eyes of the deepest blue, she is watching me.
Thad McAlister, Rise of the Witch
When horror author Thad McAlister began his latest novel, a tale rooted in the witch trials of centuries past, the words flowed effortlessly. The story poured forth, filling page after page with the most frightening character ever to crawl from his imagination. It was his greatest work, one that would guarantee him a position among the legends of the craft.
But was it really fiction?
He inadvertently opened a door, one that would soon jeopardize the lives of his family.
She wants to come back.
At home, his wife struggles to keep their family alive. Secretly wondering if she caused it all...a deal she made long ago. A deal with the Forsaken.","['23532849', '15748098', '12268318', '18529573', '8537082', '13594352', '12340312', '21858944', '23608455', '29457334', '29155233', '21980694', '23165163', '24381552', '18392219', '25626041', '22052988']",478.0,386.0,166.0,3.82,0.15058973979204907,0.15089912490277974,0.15945459989529837,0.13490584425487634,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1420527181565794,1.0,0.11757317477778513,0.1554116063552853,0.1444354173966942,0.168269301441053,0.09490147211851936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Knowing outlaw biker Callan Tilley is about to be murdered by another member of the Thunder Gypsies MC, Avery Watkins calls the police. But not all cops in Thunder Valley operate on the right side of the law, and saving Callan could cost Avery her life.
Callan has had a soft spot for the shy waitress from the first time he set eyes on her back in high school and is certain she was the one who called 911. That means she's as good as dead once the gang traces the call back to the bar where Avery works.
His plan to save them both? Steal a secret stash of the club's money, grab Avery and get the hell out of town. It might work, too, if the ATF, FBI, DEA and every other alphabet-soup agency in law enforcement were not on the hunt for a Gypsy willing to turn on the MC.

What if someone else was living in your house, running what you used to manage--and trying to kill you? Wade Forester must stay in the shadows because, it seems, everyone has reason to shoot him. His father has disappeared, and his sister won't speak a word to anyone. Beautiful Patricia Laughlin is searching for her family as well. Few people gain her trust or approval, though powerful landowner Bridger Calhoun just might be the man to do it.
After a clash throws them to opposite sides, Wade must decide if risking his life to help Patricia is worth the trouble. Bridger must win Patricia's heart, and Patricia must learn which killer to trust with her life.
Set in Nevada's silver rush, and reminiscent of Twain, the writing comes from intimate knowledge of the era and area. Having lived off the land, Wilcox depended on his wit, grit, and strength--and that of his animals--for survival, just as these characters do. Wilcox masterfully weaves authentic detail and care for the land and its creatures into a mystery that will make your heart pound and fill your lungs with the ""rarefied air"" of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

In one catastrophic instant, Haley Warren's estranged father was taken from her. She never got the chance to reconnect with him, so now she's doing it the only way she's got left: by proving the explosion that killed him was no accident.
When Tyler Brodie, the provocative and handsome P.I. hired by Haley, discovers that her father was investigating a suspected art theft, he knows his death is no coincidence. After all, tens of millions of dollars worth of stolen art could motivate a thief to go to any lengths-including getting rid of anyone poking around where they don't belong.
As Haley and Ty get closer to the truth, the truth gets ugly: Did Haley's dad know too much...or was he in on the take? And although Ty's a consummate professional, he's having trouble focusing on the facts of the case, and not the figure of his gorgeous client. The two are determined to get to the bottom of the case, even if it means they die trying.","['16000978', '17900179', '9676587', '17344482', '13545602', '15762085', '17570215', '17277997', '15942606', '16160034', '12499616', '17348304', '17900178', '10841289', '17451238', '15831824', '18050764', '3302270']",950.0,400.0,90.0,4.02,1.0,0.1177067995851479,1.0,0.08471558963767177,0.11946070992031749,0.10520069363661128,0.10248375286647005,0.08466821407110367,0.12004761954029261,0.07593520432675534,1.0,0.10306326242156329,1.0,0.06670802395301101,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Seizing this chance of initiating an exchange between two of the greatest minds in Europe, the princess showed his letter to the eminent Newtonian scientist and natural theologian, Samuel Clarke. From his reply developed an exchange of papers which was published in 1717. The correspondence was immediately seen as a crucial discussion of the significance of the new science, and it became one of the most widely read philosophical works of its time. Kant developed his theory of space and time from the problems at issue, and the post-Newtonian physics of the twentieth century has brought a revival of interest in Leibniz's objections: some of the problems are still not finally resolved. In this edition an introduction outlines the historical background, and there is a valuable survey of the subsequent discussions of the problem of space and time in the philosophy of science.

Barbara, bitter that her servitude is to continue, may be the only force that stands between Margerit and the new Baron's greed--and the ever deeper layers of intrigue that surround the ill-health of Alpennia's prince and the divine power from rituals known only as The Mysteries of the Saints.

Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected. With its imperfect but charming heroine and its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, Emma is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work.

148410,25914928,A Christmas Carol,eng,"In October 1843, Charles Dickens -- heavily in debt and obligated to his publisher -- began work on a book to help supplement his family's meagre income. That volume, A Christmas Carol,has long since become one of the most beloved stories in the English language. As much a part of the holiday season as holly, mistletoe, and evergreen wreaths, this perennial favourite continues to delight new readers and rekindle thoughts of charity and goodwill.
With its characters exhibiting many qualities -- as well as failures -- often ascribed to Dickens himself, the imaginative and entertaining tale relates Ebenezer Scrooge's eerie encounters with a series of spectral visitors. Journeying with them through Christmases past, present, and future, he is ultimately transformed from an arrogant, obstinate, and insensitive miser to a generous, warm-hearted, and caring human being. Written by one of England's greatest and most popular novelists, A Christmas Carolhas come to epitomize the true meaning of Christmas.","['563820', '1180333', '93531', '9993477', '42288', '20564', '78950', '1554931', '34431', '125321', '115538', '93818', '239810', '5319', '106749', '535856', '42036', '7331']",1.0,96.0,1.0,4.02,0.08918191230531881,1.0,0.0825015090798738,0.08823997575508892,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.08743395007279474,0.09553446735000216,0.08138198905009512,0.0930111212580892,0.09675347595988522,0.09358236832701347,0.05604162751367981,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I crave material like that...and with its great writing and believable characters, Freaks Anon nails it. It's a fanboy's dream.

1048,35446634,The War on Women,eng,"In 1973, Sue Lloyd-Roberts joined ITN as a news trainee and went on to be one of the UK's first video-journalists to report from the bleak outposts of the Soviet Union. Travelling as a tourist, she also gained access to some of the world's most impenetrable places like China, Tibet and Burma. During her 40-year-long career she witnessed the worst atrocities inflicted on women across the world. But in observing first-hand the war on the female race she also documented their incredible determination to fight back.
'The War on Women' brings to life the inconceivable and dangerous life Sue led. It tells the story of orphan Mary Merritt who, age sixteen, instead of being released from the care of nuns was interned by them in a Magdalen Laundry and forced to work twelve hours a day six days a week, without pay, for over a decade. She gives voice to Maimouna, the woman responsible for taking over her mother's role as the village female circumciser in The Gambia and provides a platform for the 11-year-old Manemma, who was married off in Jaipur at the age of six. From the gender pay gap in Britain to forced marriage in Kashmir and from rape as a weapon of war to honour killings, Sue has examined humankind's history and takes us on a journey to analyse the state of women's lives today. Most importantly she acts as a mouthpiece for the brave ones; the ones who challenge wrongdoing; the ones who show courage no matter how afraid they are; the ones who are combatting violence across the globe; the ones who are fighting back.
Sue sadly died in 2015, shortly after writing this book, today she is widely recognised as one of the most acclaimed television journalists of her generation.

The first book in the Oceanan Trilogy, it's an exciting action-adventure with themes of friendship, honor, and trust as well as doing what's right, not being too quick to judge--and intergalactic love.
Rick McCall is a spy who can't forgive himself for making the bad choice that led to the death of his wife and unborn daughter. Leonora is a brilliant scientist and high-ranking Seacat Warrior from the planet Oceana who is captured by the human army, imprisoned, and secretly subjected to experiments by government agents. All it takes is one look into her pale blue eyes, when Leonora collides with him during her attempt at freedom, for Rick's heart to stir and his life to change its course.
When he discovers that Leonora's claims about the government experimentation are true, Rick sees that he must help her and her colleague, Tigif, escape the planet, at great risk to his life and career.

174015,16488690,What Jesus Really Said about the End of the World,en-US,"From the Mayans to Martin Luther to modern doomsday preachers, there s a long list of people who predicted the end of the age and got it wrong. Does Jesus belong on that list? After all, in the Gospel of Matthew he seems to indicate the end will come within a generation, yet many generations have now passed and the world is still around. Was he mistaken, then, and was the early Church fooled by his mistake into expecting the Second Coming in the first century? In What Jesus Really Said About the End of the World, author David Currie author of Born Fundamentalist, Born Again Catholic examines Christ s end-times prophecies in an attempt to get to the bottom of this profoundly important question. Using the tools of biblical scholarship, the wisdom of the Church Fathers, plus Old Testament history and typology, he presents a fascinating and highly readable interpretation of Jesus words echoed by St. Paul and other early Christians that harmonizes with Catholic tradition and resoundingly answers the charge that Christ predicted an end that never came. In so doing he rebuts both skeptics (who crow about Jesus mistake ) and many Evangelical Christians (who resort to extrabiblical theories like the Rapture ) while giving comfort to other Christians, who have been confused or embarrassed by this seeming blow to Christ s credibility. Currie also unlocks for you the most important message behind Jesus prophecies and warnings, which is not to inspire fearful calculations about the day and hour but to remind us that our own end will surely come, so we must be always ready. Let us not look for signs to be troubled by, the Lord says to us, but instead trust in his mercy and power.",[],18.0,231.0,3.0,4.58,0.0917132685490637,1.0,0.06826453367304451,1.0,0.0994940874481448,0.09503967022247657,1.0,1.0,0.07716616422256072,0.08593724722531579,0.07060747892968958,0.07839473418959353,0.08132629474222546,0.08819127720389865,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Twenty-three years old, with a first class honours degree and forty-eight grand in student loans, Emily Davidson's sick and tired of being told she's part of the 'Snowflake Generation,' accused of having unrealistic expectations and an over-inflated sense of their own importance.
All Emily wants is a chance and she knows she has to strive to get it.
There's no easy route into political journalism - she has to make a splash.
Emily sees a world of senseless wars, western democracy in crisis, the re-emergence of the far right. The rich get richer, the poor and vulnerable can go to hell, and drugs are the only escape for millions. Yet the media is full of football, celebrities and fake news.
Her generation didn't create this screwed up world - but they're going to inherit it. Armed only with a video camera, Emily sets out to shine a light on the chaos - starting at the bottom of the heap - South-East Asia, where poverty and the drugs trade are endemic.
Her journey takes her to Bangkok, where the darkest side of Asia and western capitalism collide in spectacular fashion.
Daeng is the street-wise local who promises to guide her through the underbelly of Thai society and deliver the perfect coup de grace for her film.

In the fall of 2013, while at a crossroads in life after a divorce, Aaron Lauritsen, did what many of us dream of doing but few ever will, he put his problems in the rearview mirror and headed out the door. After selling his business and all his possessions, he and his trusty K9 companion, Athena-bear, jumped in his Toyota pick-up truck, then ventured into the heart of North America for a road trip to end all road trips.
Because he hoped that by getting lost out there, he would somehow find himself again, he left without a plan or even a map, then for one hundred glorious days journeyed the continent carefree, via secondaries that were not only off the beaten track, but that were often all but forgot.
On them he traversed some 30,000 zig-zagging miles through thirty eight of the lower forty eight states and seven of the ten Canadian provinces. And yielded in the process an untold number of encounters weaved by confronting personal fears, history, worldly cities, eccentric people and adventurous activities. The real prize afforded by the time, distance and space however, was his spiritual awakening.
Follow along as he paints that epic voyage of discovery and experience the same unexpected serendipity that awaited them around each bend of the open road.","['370373', '8942672', '28672267', '243196', '21803292', '20932825', '22071309', '19332804', '22678914', '18346698', '20758075', '2035286', '27984081', '21488201', '713664', '17300236', '12648447']",9.0,366.0,3.0,4.58,0.10458986820914502,1.0,0.09351309240647668,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.11080589549826052,0.11496620708068174,0.094103328926968,0.10170831897008643,0.09475139967085168,0.11144094062743448,0.10685950335128497,0.08024258645041636,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

--Anne McCaffrey
Komarr--Miles Vorkosigan is sent to Komarr, a planet that could be a garden with a thousand more years of terraforming; or an uninhabitable wasteland, if the terraforming project fails. The solar mirror vital to the project has been shattered by a ship hurtling off course, and Miles has been sent to find out if it was an accident, or sabotage. But once there, he uncovers a plot that could exile him from Barrayar forever--and discovers an unexpected ally, one with wounds as deep and honor as beleaguered as his own.
A Civil Campaign--On Komarr, Miles met the beautiful Vor widow Ekaterin Vorsoisson, who has no intention of getting married after the heartbreak and betrayal of her first experience. But Miles has a cunning plan to change her mind. Unfortunately his clone-brother Mark and his cousin Ivan have cunning plans of their own, and the three- way collision of cunning plans threatens to undo Miles's brilliant romantic strategy.
""Winterfair Gifts""--Miles and Ekaterin make elaborate preparations for their wedding. But Miles has an enemy who is plotting to turn the romantic ceremony into a festival of death.

Though Carrie can't deny the attraction she feels towards Joel, she isn't the kind of woman who lets people in easily. Especially not drop-dead gorgeous men who look like trouble.
Fate shines its light on Joel, giving him the perfect opportunity to sweep Carrie off her feet while showing her that he isn't the man she thinks he is. Hope Falls, California, is the perfect place to do that. With the magic of the picturesque mountain town and its people as their backdrop, Joel and Carrie share the sweetest, sexiest, longest first date ever.
Between bowling at Lone Pines Lanes, slow dancing at JT's Roadhouse, and getting lost in the aisles of a used bookstore, will Joel finally talk Carrie into letting herself be carried away by what they feel for one another? Or will the fear of letting herself trust and rely on someone have her running the other way?

314230,26486852,How We Write: Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blank Page,en-CA,"This little book arose spontaneously, in the late spring of 2015, when a series of conversations emerged -- first in a university roundtable on graduate student dissertation-writing, and then in a rapidly proliferating series of blog posts -- on the topic of how we write. One commentary generated another, each one characterized by enormous speed, eloquence, and emotional forthrightness. This collection is not about how TO write, but how WE write: unlike a prescriptive manual that promises to unlock the secret to efficient productivity, the contributors talk about their own writing processes, in all their messy, frustrated, exuberant, and awkward dis/order.
The contributors range from graduate students and recent PhDs to senior scholars working in the fields of medieval studies, art history, English literature, poetics, early modern studies, musicology, and geography. All are engaged in academic writing, but some of the contributors also publish in other genres, includes poetry and fiction. Several contributors maintain a very active online presence, including blogs and websites; all are committed to strengthening the bonds of community, both in person and online, which helps to explain the effervescent sense of collegiality that pervades the volume, creating linkages across essays and extending outward into the wide world of writers and readers.

""THE LISTENING ROOM"":
A kind of psychological profiling so exquisite it could duplicate minds.
Some aspect of particle physics.
Entanglement.
""Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon, certainly. We'll know the specifics in time,"" Klaus Meyer had said. ""After all the Cube's function is an aspect of the quantum realm. I'm intrigued, obviously. We're all intrigued.""
As a previous and likely future CEO of the BioMet and PrimeLogic consortium, Klaus Meyer was more than intrigued: he kept his key in a Moehler safe at the Bureau of Weights and Standards in nearby Gaithersburg, Maryland, and in the incestuous manner with which the leading software companies policed themselves it was Klaus, escorted by enforcers recently seconded en mass from the F.B.I. and temporarily badged with the Information Technology Division, who had insisted the Cube must be shut down.
""A kind of goodwill gesture, Sterling,"" he had said. ""What might be suspected should never be known. A non-subscribed and unsupervised Artificial Intelligence. Absent further advances I'm not really sure we have the technology to adequately supervise The Cube. A 'wild' AI, Sterling. Contained. But wild. And it happens to be our own. Shutting it down would be the elegant solution.""
Klaus, whose pale eyes had always glazed at the very idea of ""elegant"" anything including elegant code; Klaus, who, like a raptor in a perfect thermal, had risen effortlessly in the hierarchy of the world's premiere policing institution.
The Bureau of Weights and Standards Information Technology Division, or ITD, now a dark hydra with global reach, Klaus its leader and most sincere and ruthless advocate. The artists of prediction had been extensively studied for decades, H.G. Wells to Bester, Asimov to Herbert, Arthur C. Clarke through Bruce Sterling, William Gibson and Charles Stross; Iain Banks and his epic Culture to Louis Karpov and his Tides of the Mind, Tilde Demimonde and her Is This the Sound of Breaking Glass, Reuben Constantine and his Thinking Angels, Walking Softly
.
It had been the natural conclusion in this age of continuously evolving artificial intelligence, more than halfway through a new century, that William Gibson all the way back in 1983 had most accurately modeled the need for an all powerful enforcement mechanism in his staggering accomplishment of predestination, Neuromancer. Gibson's Turing Police now wore the badge of the United States ITD, could melt the moon with a stare, had infinite discretion and an infinite budget. And as far as Sterling could tell had no oversight whatsoever, other than the sociopath presently seated before him.
A ghost lingered, so far unnamed. Toshi Sanjiro, college roommate, colleague, apostate. Toshi, who apparently had his own version of the Cube, and as head of Sony Robotics had given his version a kind of life.
""Let the common behave like animals and fools, Sterling,"" Klaus said. ""Men have been screwing their digital servants for forty years. But we must maintain a higher standard. ITD has no choice in this instance: Toshi is breaking the law. A multitude of laws. Our laws. He has created and embodied an unsupervised AI. He has animated a super intelligence. He has created a consort of unknown powers and abilities, for his own carnal needs, his own amusement. We should consider his betrayal obscene.""
""I'm not sure that's what he had in mind,"" Sterling had replied.
Sterling had met Toshi's ""servant.""
And had known, instantly, that she was another order of magnitude entirely...",[],12.0,25.0,3.0,4.67,1.0,1.0,0.07044774365971564,1.0,1.0,0.06950494123636948,0.07334254547949735,0.07133343580468181,0.06521327918055196,0.057315997532170426,0.0659459621092116,0.06535155889160434,0.07633474436640365,0.0502812820623833,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

""An autobiography is only to be trusted"" George Orwell once wrote, ""when it reveals something disgraceful. A man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats."" With Last Days of the Cross, Joseph Ridgwell, bastard son of Arturo Bandini and the Artful Dodger, admirably rises (or perhaps sinks) to the challenge. It's with a mix of bleak authenticity, lunatic ambition but above all self-deprecating charm that Ridgwell creates a gem of a book that will horrify the more faint-hearted of the cognoscenti (but, frankly, to hell with them).
The rich seams of misery and near-ruin have long been mined for literary greatness: Knut Hamsun's Hunger, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground, W. H. Davies' The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp. Long is the list of those who've sought out enlightenment amidst lives led below the breadline (whether through choice or necessity), using the force of will to survive and somehow prosper through the grimness. In the Last Days of the Cross, there are barrel-loads of misery. Rail-trucks full of it. There's so much it has its own factories and Five Year Plans with Ridgwell a veritable Stakhanov at the coalface. Misery, debauchery, destitution, thwarted dreams and the burning resolve of the damned. Last Days of the Cross has it all in abundance. It is also one of the funniest books you'll read this year.
The book recounts the trials and adventures of young Joseph having departed the shores of Blighty, bound for the care-free beaches of Australia and literary greatness. Instead our hero finds himself living in a dosshouse amidst the ramshackle decadence of Sydney's red-light district, falling in love with a junky aborigine girl called Rosie who robs him blind and periodically leaves him to wallow lovelorn amongst bottles of rot-gut wine, porn cubicles and peeping toms. The twin struggles of finding love and writing his masterpiece propel the book through picaresque encounters with addicts, lecherous spinsters and the eternal evils of the landlord and the boss.
For a writer like Ridgwell who has carved out a reputation as something of a literary pugilist (never ceasing to stir up trouble, intentionally or not), Last Days of the Cross is a surprisingly freewheeling story, being hilariously self-deprecating and quixotic. Unlike many of the hipster free-verse disciples of Bukowski, Ridgwell has learned the old bard's most valuable lesson; it's not believing in some sense of smug deadbeat cool that counts, it's being aware of and utterly honest about your own innate ridiculousness. Last Days... is funniest at its most triumphant and its bleakest (often these moments are indistinguishable); ""No longer would I be Joseph Ridgwell, the Bard of Kings Cross but Joseph Ridgwell: Peanut King!""
For all the bravado that you fear may come with its subject matter, it's an astonishingly open-hearted book in an age when literary games, trickery and dislocation seem paramount, a tender, even gentle, carouse through the gutter. There's even an openness to the world that marks Ridgwell out as a romantic. Sure enough there's something in here to offend everyone, with the narrator throwing out casual insults and non-PC remarks continually along the way but it's done with a disarming charm and more importantly the redeeming fact that Ridgwell fully includes himself in the sorry morass of humanity.
For a book which concentrates on the folly and freedom (to starve) of the aspiring bohemian, there is, not surprisingly, a great deal of focus on the act of writing itself or rather the lack of. Seeking Li Po's long-vacated poetic throne, Ridgwell soon finds himself at war with the blank page or in this case the blank screen, raging against his laptop and the Microsoft logo ""which kept moving in diagonal directions"" and which mocks his inactivity (""So you think you can defeat me, eh? You inanimate technological object! You think you can get one over on the world's greatest living poet, ha, you mug. Can't you see the odds are stacked against you?""). He labours to write odes inspired by the prostitutes viewed from his window or nature or, in one case, a museum painting. Ridgwell ""Poet of Clouds,"" Ridgwell ""the Brick Poet."" He fails, initially at least, at each.
With an honesty that avoids worthiness, Ridgwell tries to write an epic about ""the street kids, drunkards... the lost, the lonely, the marginalised and the dispossessed"" in the comically-superior hope his ""childhood home"" will be ""turned into a museum and shrine by the Ridgwell Appreciation Society"" and ""there would be guided tours of the Cross - Ridgwell drank in this bar, sat on that very stool."" He emerges, it has to be said, with a genuinely great poem Kings Cross at 6AM but conquering art is one thing. Conquering life is not as easy.
The course of love never runs smooth and Ridgwell fluctuates from writing smitten rhapsodies to Rosie to vengeful odes armed with ""disgusting adjectives, fiery metaphors and accusing similes."" Occasionally he falls into the nihilism that is the disappointment of the failed romantic, ""We could never be together and it was madness to think otherwise... who did I think I was? I was no poet, no artist. Only people with trust funds or inmates of lunatic asylums could call themselves such flaky things."" The love boat repeatedly crashes against the rocks of the everyday, as Mayakovsky's suicide note went. Heartache and joy and uncertainty inevitably await.
As much a chart of the perils and highs of romance, Last Days... is concerned with the struggle of the modern soul for authentic experience, for solitude and some deeper wisdom, against the jobs, the managers, the whinging realists, the hangovers, the writers block and the long dark nights of the soul which all conspire to derail us. Ridgwell flirts with the dark side, chasing the dragon with his erstwhile lover, ""I didn't care about anything because nothing mattered. Writing was ridiculous; poetry absurd, the patrons of such arts demented and the artists themselves a bunch of pretentious, preening egotists"" a happiness that ""was filled with resounding echoes of hollow and empty transience."" It's symbolic of the book as a whole, when all the highs are transitory and have sadness in them because they are so fleeting. Observations in Last Days... come as lightly as they do in life but with a real importance than can easily be missed. Ridgwell talks of mortality and age in movingly simple terms (""how does that shit happen?""). He studies monstrous Ibis birds, ""their white plumage blackened by pollution, exhaust fumes, a sorry vaguely intimidating sight. Their strange bills made me shudder; evil. What is it about the city and city life? Look what it does to people and even animals. It brutalises everything.""
On occasion, Ridgwell delivers a startling stop-dead-in-your-tracks turn-of-phrase; ""the next day I awoke to find my tiny bed-sit glowing like the inside of a cathedral or an expectant mother's womb,"" commuting to work in a packed train feeling like ""a bag of solidified shit"" or as said of a work colleague stuck in a deadening job, ""no wonder an air of eternal regret followed him around like a sad refrain or wistful lament."" Mostly, there's an endearing mix of the naive and the streetwise sides of the narrator,
""Follow me,"" he whispered.
""Where to?"" I whispered back.
""To the roof!""
Fuck it, I thought. Maybe he's got a telescope up there and I'd always fancied doing a bit of stargazing...
Up on the roof, Beardy adopted a more conspiratorial air.
Ridgwell's air of flippant disrespect continues with his healthy hatred of management, referring to his building-site boss as ""moustache man"" and Village People (""once he'd fucked off I assessed the situation""). The plentiful humour in the face of stark reality is one reason to read this book. Another is to find out the significance of the number 6789. Or how a man can let down the dishonourable traditions of the Poetes maudits by not havng sex with a ladyboy.
Last Days of the Cross is ultimately a lament for a dying world where the joys and miseries of semi-destitution and hedonism are replaced by the simple dulleries of work and streets full of the same coffee shops and department stores as everywhere else, the horrors of gentrification. ""The scene was moving on. Junkies were vanishing, drunks and vagrants being rounded up and dispersed... and the people moving in were different - professional-types, city workers... lovers of cafe society and spotless sidewalks.""
""Where does it all go?"" Ridgwell wonders in the end ""the junkies, misfits, hookers... drunks,"" hoping to follow the drift ""to the next frontline because there's always got to be a frontline somewhere...""",[],5.0,280.0,1.0,5.0,0.24118554696615774,1.0,0.21341995837791758,0.22314858380017633,1.0,0.21842969664578968,1.0,0.21643948406106123,0.2242412980339124,0.1877219678402071,0.214676925852381,1.0,0.2405457975025508,0.18303436511987942,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

And as she lay suspended between life and death, Narain felt confident enough in the timing to visit her. It would be only one visit when her condition left her unable or perhaps unwilling to fully comprehend that a brother 20 years older than her still lived and looked 70 years younger than she. But it would hopefully lead to some closures.
Weeks later, though, as Narain is beginning to regain his emotional footing, another fragment of his past arrives threatening the peace he's at last attained. He comes face to face with the consequences of a thoughtless and careless act committed so many decades before and indeed, he is completely unprepared for it.
To save those he loves, victims of his mistake, Narain must turn to his greatest nemesis for help and agree to the harsh terms that Reg Jameson is only too glad to put forth.",[],5.0,392.0,4.0,4.6,0.17663049862152108,0.16556995908554636,0.17178818464710205,0.17908781486775144,1.0,0.16254874009190673,1.0,0.15987355495197167,0.18032839912337517,0.14497163704423213,0.17397118869568678,1.0,1.0,0.1028898707462491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

The analyses in the book investigate the possibilities and foundations of a completely new philosophy of history, although outlined in dialogue with M. Heidegger. The fundamental questions the author asks are: Why, wherefrom is there history? Why are we humans historical? Why is there historiography? Primarily and ultimately, the response to each of these questions is: because we are MORTAL. Accordingly, the first chapter tackles the possibilities and lays the foundations of an ontology of history. Built upon these, the second chapter analyses the being of the PAST and its existential characteristics - as NOT-BEING-ANY-MORE, as HAD-BEEN-NESS. Chapter three turns towards the FUTURE and analyses its existential characteristics as NOT-YET-BEING. Chapter four is an explicit return to the dialogue with Heidegger, which surfaces the main aspects of the essential belonging together of the fundaments and origins of philosophy and history. The Appendix is an applied philosophical research related to the previous subjects which examines the interlacements of DEATH and SECRET in the phenomenon of TERRORISM.",[],5.0,180.0,1.0,4.8,1.0,0.12865185266916274,0.1034041511797091,1.0,0.10896623723148653,0.10551199461354994,0.11860812785622235,1.0,1.0,0.08774505230978491,0.12611868013231325,0.09343789336323759,0.1283312037612879,0.08795465177708622,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

221037,18479614,Realm Keepers: Episode Five,en-US,"Between Earth and Chaos, Six Children Battle For Our Survival
An epic serialized fantasy for all ages
What if you and your friends went to another world every time you went to sleep?
What if you spent half your life on Earth and the other half fighting for survival against foes too terrible to be real?
And what if you could never tell anyone?
This is reality for the Realm Keepers: six kids from Earth thrust into a terrifying war between Midrealm and Chaos. Plucked from their ordinary lives and given extraordinary powers, they're the only thing standing between us and destruction.
In Episode Five, Tess faces strife both at home and in Midrealm. On Earth, she and her family engaged in a struggle for survival less dramatic, and yet no less perilous than that in Midrealm. And as a Realm Keeper, she and the others are struggling to outwit Terrence and discover what he wants with the tombs of the Six. Desperate, they set out on a trek across country to discover the truth. But sometimes the truth is a far more dangerous thing than ignorance.
This is the fifth episode of Realm Keepers. Each volume consists of six regular episodes, and a Finale that is three times the length (and price) of a single episode, told from the perspective of all six kids.
>>>""An excellent beginning to this fantasy adventure. I look forward to reading more of this series.""
Ray Alan Nicholson, Reviewer
>>>""This first episode is a great start to a YA Fantasy series that even adults can enjoy...Well written, interesting characters, promising premise.""
Eric Guindon, The Siege Perilous Podcast
>>>""It's clear the writers put a lot of effort into developing each personality early on. The story line is still gripping. It moves, but it doesn't move so fast that you feel it's unrealistic...Needless to say, I'm a fan. On to the next one.""

Fully updated for the newest innovations, it demonstrates each protocol in action through realistic examples from modern Linux, Windows, and Mac OS environments. There's no better way to discover why TCP/IP works as it does, how it reacts to common conditions, and how to apply it in your own applications and networks. Building on the late W. Richard Stevens' classic first edition, author Kevin R. Fall adds his cutting-edge experience as a leader in TCP/IP protocol research, updating the book to fully reflect the latest protocols and best practices. He first introduces TCP/IP's core goals and architectural concepts, showing how they can robustly connect diverse networks and support multiple services running concurrently. Next, he carefully explains Internet addressing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Then, he walks through TCP/IP's structure and function from the bottom up: from link layer protocols-such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi-through network, transport, and application layers. Fall thoroughly introduces ARP, DHCP, NAT, firewalls, ICMPv4/ICMPv6, broadcasting, multicasting, UDP, DNS, and much more. He offers extensive coverage of reliable transport and TCP, including connection management, timeout, retransmission, interactive data flow, and congestion control. Finally, he introduces the basics of security and cryptography, and illuminates the crucial modern protocols for protecting security and privacy, including EAP, IPsec, TLS, DNSSEC, and DKIM. Whatever your TCP/IP experience, this book will help you gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding of the entire protocol suite so you can build better applications and run more reliable, efficient networks.","['845795', '135437', '685486', '6813247', '871669', '12042357', '10896369', '11493988', '6492189', '13550641', '10198038']",73.0,1017.0,3.0,4.56,1.0,0.02699559234362431,0.025014698901940174,1.0,0.0262144615928874,0.026208107005123337,0.024755425852382995,1.0,0.02295078384377728,0.023609777464370794,0.023081758116713976,0.02571840598471825,1.0,0.019831850446975732,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

All Big Red Fortunato wants to do . . . is clear his name and get his movie studio running in the black, but lately problems appear whenever he tries to leave Queens.
Was it destiny that caused the world's most beautiful actress to be shoved into the protective arms of the most powerful mobster in Queens, NY at the exact moment that assassins tried to kill her? Red wonders who wants her dead, and why?
This was a war Big Red never wanted, but he's not immune to the charms of the beautiful actress. Red never wore his heart on his sleeve but the more he gets to know Marilyn Monroe the more he finds himself drawn to her. But sinister forces are at work and, as he tries to protect the beautiful movie queen; he is unwittingly drawn into a web of deceit that reaches into the highest levels of government.
Red tells Marilyn . . . ""From now on wherever you go Trenchie goes with you. And if he's with you, you'll stay alive.""
Red is proud of his three fighters. Henri was just crowned the Welterweight Champ. Swifty is scheduled to fight for the Middleweight Championship of the world - but Red's heavyweight fighter Gonzo has a problem. His opponent has just lapsed into a coma from a powerhouse right hand to his head ... and he may not live.
Joey Bones shook his head. ""What do we do now? Here we are holed up with the most popular female star in the world and if the authorities find that we have her, they'll think we kidnapped her.""
Richard Nixon is scheduled to speak at the Republican Convention in Madison Square garden, where assassins plan to kill him. Red must protect Nixon and his family. The question is - why is Nixon being targeted? Red wonders. Is there a connection between Marilyn and Nixon?
In Madison Square Garden Red asks Frankie Carbo. ""Frankie if you wanted to kill Nixon, where would you place your shooter."" ""That's easy."" He said pointing to the highest point in the Garden. ""I'd put him up there in the eagle's
nest.""
She whispered to him softly, ""I only have one good friend and that's ... Joe."" Her hand lingered over his scars and his hand remained over hers. Her face was close to his, almost brushing it. He turned to say something, but their lips touched and he kissed her tenderly. The kiss lingered longer than either of them expected. He didn't want the kiss to end, but he broke away.
Marilyn promised Frank Sinatra that she'd be at the grand opening of his Cal Neva Lodge. Red wants to go with her for protection, but problems with a Neo Nazi group has surfaced so instead he sends Joey Bones to protect her.
""Make sure nothing happens to her Joey. Because if something does, I'm holding you responsible.""
A Nazi youth group desecrates a Jewish Temple in Queens and the Rabbi is threatened. Red must deal with the problem.
Red made sure that Frankie the Horse's wife received a check every week he was in prison. But now he's out and he wants more money. What does he have that can hurt Red?.
It was hard for Piss Clam to do, but he completed the job. Now Red asks him to follow him into the cellar, but Piss Clam is worried about who might be down there waiting for him.

Never quite accepted as a local, he navigates the path of conscience through the pitfalls of personal loneliness.

Ann Joslin of A Sandusky Bay Journal describes Night Voices as ""an exciting novel of adventure."" In McGowan's Call, this talented writer explores the inner landscape of those who find themselves inserted in the personal crises of others. Rob Smith's short stories have appeared nationally in Writer's Journal and other literary magazines. In 2006, he received the Robert Frost Poetry Award for his poem Catbird.

So began the Vengeance Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi.
Now the Assassin is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.
Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.
Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path.

The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.
Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled.

It is simply a matter of awareness. Though we often feel lost and abandoned in a cold and uncaring world, the truth is that we live in the illusion of our own self-created exile, away from the Source of our being which has never stopped loving us -- unconditionally. The time has come to awaken and pass through the darkness of our fear induced slumber to embrace the light of truth, and find our way back to the infinite light of love that comes to us from the Source of all creation. Awareness is presence, which means being fully present, in the present, right here, right now, in this moment, standing in the light of truth, which is the greatest present anyone can receive. Matthew Pallamary's SPIRIT MATTERS chronicles his life long search for truth, which took him from the false spirituality of a violent concrete jungle in an Irish Catholic ghetto in Boston, to the discovery of true spirituality in the jungles of the Amazon where he discovered the truth.

....thus reads the final words of High School Senior Joshua Feranna.
Several years later, Lew, his father, currently working for a faceless loan shark, has dipped into a drug and lust-filled method of cope. Separated but not divorced, his wife Autumn finally tracks Lew down, begging him to come home to help take care of their identity-in-crisis daughter Zoey.
But when Lew's friend from high school, Sarah Fox, having lived the life of a drummer in the all-but extinct rock band ""The Bastards"" returns to town stalked by a rumored ""Resurrection Tour"", Lew's world truly becomes a thing of legend....and doubt.
What transpires from then on is a continuing snowball effect that will inevitably lead to the cataclysmic destruction of one family and others as the world continues to busy itself around them in seamless melancholy.

The conditions under which we live in France are so different from those to which people at home are accustomed, that no pen, however skilful, can explain them without the aid of the pencil.
The destruction caused by war, the wide areas of devastation, the vast mechanical agencies essential in war, both for transport and the offensive, the masses of supplies required, and the wonderful cheerfulness and indomitable courage of the soldiers under varying climatic conditions, are worthy subjects for the artist who aims at recording for all time the spirit of the age in which he has lived.
It has been said that the portrait and the picture are invaluable aids to the right reading of history. From this point of view I welcome, on behalf of the Army that I have the honour to command, this series of drawings, as a permanent record in pencil of the duties which our soldiers have been called upon to perform, and the quality and manner of its performance.

she used for an accordion case.

a cavity just inside her ear
where the curve of a sound pushed through
her fingers and into the buttons of that strange machine.

Cage captures similarities in the respective desert landscapes of both Iraq and Nevada, but it is not just a study in contrasting landscapes. The inter-connected stories explore similarities and differences in human needs from the perspectives of vastly different cultures. Specifically, the stories deftly capture the overlap in the respective desert landscapes of each region, the contrasting cultures and worldviews, and the common need for hope. Taken together, the stories represent the arc of a year-long deployment by young soldiers.

How can I believe in miracles if I have never experienced one?
Aren't miracles just something people made up to explain what they couldn't understand?
How can we discern whether a phenomenon is truly a miracle and not a hallucination, a hoax, or the work of a demon?
In this booklet you'll find smart, solid answers to these questions and many more. The rare and wonderful supernatural events we call miracles are a gift from God, testifying to a skeptical world of his existence and his power. 20 Answers: Miracles unpacks the nature of miracles, their appearances in Scripture and history, how the Church evaluates them, and ways to answer doubters who say they're mere superstition. Most of all, it shows that miracles are never an end in themselves, but instead are meant to lead us to greater faith in, and gratitude for, God's providence.

I used to be numb, until I discovered what it was to feel again, thanks to Virgil. He pulled me out of the darkness and bewitched me, somehow.
He messed up my mind.
Overwhelmed my heart.
For once, I was willing to welcome some of those irrational emotions. Why did he hold back? I wanted him and he pushed me away.
Wounded by Virgil's indecisions, I foolishly believed in the fairytale my summer fling offered. Who am I kidding? I'm no princess and this man is definitely not my Prince Charming. That is made apparent by Virgil's re-appearance, but can I trust him to pull me in and not push me away again?
I wasn't expecting the dark fairytale that Virgil weaves of the Irish star-crossed lovers. A witch and a monk forever entwined and destined to be together.
Could Virgil and I actually be soulmates, brought back together by an ancient spell, bound to embrace this unorthodox fairytale and a happy ending? Or will this become our deadly ever after?

207349,8610941,Salty as a Lip,eng,"At once personal and public, the poems in Salty as a Lip are ""as playful as love notes,"" according to the poet James Ragan. Throughout the book, Mashak grapples with difficult questions using wordplay and a lighthearted tone that belies his sincerity. Much of Mashak's work catches the reader off guard with sudden, serious ramifications.
Mashak seems to realize that poetry won't change the world, but believes poets should engage current affairs. At times, he plays the role of poetry's class clown, a jester forcing introspection.
Even when he is describing subjects he does not necessarily approve of, Mashak never loses his essential empathy, the sense that every human is struggling to make sense of existence.

Through an examination of the texts and editorial histories of Thomas Shepard's conversion narratives, the captivity narrative of Mary Rowlandson, and the poetry of Emily Dickinson, Howe reads our intellectual inheritance as a series of civil wars, where each text is a wilderness in which a strange and lawless author confronts interpreters and editors eager for settlement.

Writing letters home to her sister Emily is Hannah Zartman's lifeline. It's 1798, and Hannah's life no longer bears a speck of resemblance to the affluent city life she left behind to marry Georg, a Hessian mercenary turned colonist. Hannah can milk a cow, deliver piglets, churn butter, quilt and spin, and even shoot a bear should the need arise, as she tends the land and the daily needs of nine rambunctious children in a rustic Pennsylvania log cabin. But this year, harder things are pressing from every side, shaking Hannah's commitment to the harsh frontier life she has chosen and to the man she loves. As the Zartmans grieve an agonizing loss and await the birth of another mouth to feed, their farm is on the brink of financial disaster.

When the war ended, Michael had cast out one third of the disobedient angels who chose to disobey Jah and follow after Soretoe. They all landed in a place of dense darkness known as Tartarus, located near the rim of the earths crust to await the final battle at Megiddo, a battle they knew they could not win.
Jah took away most of their powers after they brazenly mated and reproduced with humans releasing bully giants into the world, called Nephilim. Generation after generation of their male offspring grew shorter and less powerful, averaging only six to seven feet in height by the year 2077. As they assimilated into human society, more human than half spirit, most continued to serve Soretoe and traveled back and forth from the dense darkness of Tartarus into earth's bright, sunny atmosphere. Some, but very few, of the younger, giant, immortals wanted to leave Tartarus, altogether and were not loyal or supportive to the fallen society. Regrettably, they often disappeared - never to be heard from again.
One day, while roaming the earth and walking about in it, Soretoe encountered an overly zealous seventh grader, named Evie Eversoul, trying to do good deeds, helping her friends, and warning the world about Nephilim. She really aroused great anger in Soretoe. She made him crazy mad. In fact, Soretoe was so mad, that he desperately wanted to destroy her and all her good intentions, but Jah wouldn't let him.
Fully aware that Evie Eversoul was different from the average girl living in the city of Faith, Soretoe set his plans in motion to sabotage and wreck every good deed she put into play. Evie had a gift...a gift beyond what was normal, and someday soon she would become Crystal Clear. On that unique day, she'd come to understand the purpose, and wisdom behind her special gift, and the meaning behind the last and seventh eclipse.
But for now, Evie was dealing with her looks, her wants, and her needs, in other words, me, myself, and I. Boys, the makeup thing, the bra thing, the fashion thing, and the feeling thing were what mattered in her life. She had no idea that somebody called Soretoe was always lurking around, in the shadows, watching her every move and trying to turn everything she did into a disaster waiting to happen.

Their journey has finally led them to Styx Castle, where they meet Millicent, a human maid who wound up in Styx due to mysterious (and embarrassing) circumstances, and Delilah, a goblin queen with a taste for the chaotic.
But Bostwick's theft of the Domino does not go unnoticed. To avoid a harsher punishment, he agrees to be Delilah's butler for a hundred years. Before he can escape the queen's clutches, he'll have to face mad bombers, an all-bugbear police force, romantic schemes gone awry, and a mysterious goblin-turned-cat named Sebastian who also has designs on the Domino. And as if that wasn't enough, he soon learns that Millicent is also a magician--and needs him to teach her!","['13163921', '144073', '96629', '2824100', '194045', '540947', '27276474', '836663', '28162127', '17449705', '103643', '315752']",4.0,242.0,3.0,4.6,1.0,1.0,0.06459784679483839,0.04485542073314119,0.0593684784566798,0.07260551372124036,1.0,0.0490598804539244,1.0,0.040624196217206594,0.07223561813837856,0.05300702907575219,0.06963723061817079,0.03497263362535049,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Nearly thirty and unmarried, Miss Landings finds she can no longer hide behind her clandestine dress-up moments as Bette Davis, nor can she deny a smoldering passion for her boss John Graham, avoid ""The Very Big Secret"" that drove away her ex-beau Howard or use the author pseudonym that becomes her undoing. She fancies herself as a writer but takes the only job available--as elevator operator in the town's only department store. Each time the elevator doors close, the hidden stage where lives - and lies - unravel, Miss Margaret Landings comes closer to the truth about herself. As familiar a story in the 1950s as it is for women today, this intimate journey of self-discovery is a page-turner of suspense, humor and poignancy from the opening unveiling of secrets to the final shocking revelation. And that's no lie, because nothing stays secret forever.

Darkness Rising
Chateau Seduction 0.5
Antoine Chevalier harbors a secret. Born a gargoyle shifter, he wants nothing more than to cultivate his art. His hard work pays off the night he completes his greatest sculpture. But the excitement of his accomplishment doesn't last.
He's drawn the eye of the wrong group--a clan of vampires. Antoine wakes into darkness, changed. Shattered. His dream of becoming a renowned sculptor is destroyed.
One question remains--how will he ever survive an eternity of darkness alone?
Darkness Rising is part 0.5 of the Chateau Seductions series by USA Today Bestselling author Lisa Carlisle. Readers have requested more on the dark and mysterious Antoine. In this novelette, Antoine tells his tale, which continues in the series with Dark Velvet. Dark Velvet is written from Savannah's perspective as a newcomer to an art colony who is intrigued by the proprietor.
Dark Velvet
Chateau Seductions Part 1
Grad student Savannah Evans is thrilled to be accepted as a resident to a prestigious art colony. Where else would she be able to focus on her craft of writing poetry in a setting like that of the medieval-styled castle? The remote New England island is a respite from her hectic city life. When she meets her benefactor, a mysterious French sculptor, her expectations for carefree days writing near the ocean are distracted by unprofessional fantasies about her sponsor.
Antoine Chevalier built Les Beaux Arts on DeRoche Island to bring purpose back to an existence that has lost meaning. He's wandered the earth for decades and finds solace in returning to art. When Savannah applies for a residency, something about her words touches him. After her arrival, a physical attraction grows between them, which he struggles against. She deserves more than someone of his kind.
Antoine proposes they become lovers during her stay. But the situation turns complicated when Savannah discovers his secret. She had suspicions about his identity, but finds the truth overwhelming. Consumed by her desire for Antoine and faced with a tough decision, she is blind to the danger that has arrived at DeRoche Island.
Dark Muse
Chateau Seductions Part 2
It takes time before Gina Meiro warms up to people and her shyness is often misunderstood. She hasn't had to worry about meeting new people at a remote art colony until a new resident arrives--a rock guitarist more suited for a billboard. Her carefree days of painting at the medieval-styled castle on a remote New England island are shattered when she stumbles right into his welcome gathering.
After a falling out with his band, Dante Riani wants nothing more at Les Beaux Arts on DeRoche Island than solitude to work on new songs. When a shy young painter asks to paint him at sunset, he's tempted by the opportunity to be alone with her.
Someone at the colony claims to know what Dante is and asks for his help. Dante fears his plans are coming undone, especially as he grows more drawn to Gina. Her scent and vulnerability are too difficult to resist. But he must stay away from her--she would never understand his secret.",[],10.0,218.0,10.0,5.0,0.19595797851140653,1.0,0.15402703259057907,0.15509863181675662,0.1784423963776845,0.18325803342084732,1.0,0.14709789757986344,1.0,0.15067782840745006,0.19166696099899677,0.16636894854819823,1.0,0.11373010539852321,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Native American teens Kai and Dakota, despite harboring secrets of their own, join the team, and swear undying loyalty to Lance. They carry the hope of their people that the crusade will better the lives of Indian children, who are the most neglected by government. This new campaign will take the young people to The White House, the halls of Congress, and beyond in their quest to change the prevailing opinion that children are property, rather than human beings in their own right.

Lance, Ricky, Kai, and Dakota become the enemy's favorite targets, and barely escape with their lives on more than one occasion. Who is this mysterious stalker, and what is the motive for these attacks? Lance has no idea, especially since he's never intentionally hurt anyone.

From the Author
I've taught the A to Zs of Buying a Franchise for more than 25 years at the International Franchise Expo and at franchise conferences in many countries, and it never fails that I get this question: ""What are the hot franchises to buy today?"" I always smile and say, ""Buying a hot franchise is the fastest way to get burned!"" The audience laughs, but still, they want to buy a ""hot"" franchise. And since I believe in helping customers get what they want, I decided to write Buy ""Hot"" Franchises Without Getting Burned, A Checklist For Your Franchising Success.
Of course, the broader message is that you can buy any type of franchise without getting ""burned"" and that's especially true if you follow a systematic approach to exploring and evaluating franchises. In this book, I've delivered that systematic approach.
No one can guarantee your success in franchising, but you can do much to insure that you select a franchise that will reward you appropriately, both personally and financially. Give yourself an opportunity to explore the possibilities in franchising . . . there are 75 different industries in the USA using franchising for business development . . . those industries support nearly 3,000 different franchise concepts . . . there's a good chance at least one of those concepts will excite you.
Many franchises cost less than $25,000 to start -- some less than $10,000 -- and many franchises can be operated from home or a small office. Other franchises cost more than $250,000 to start and require stand-alone buildings, or stores in strip centers and malls. What matters most is that you discover what's best for you. You can use Buy ""Hot"" Franchises Without Getting Burned to find out, and to find a franchise brand that's a good fit for you. By any definition, when you do that, that's a ""hot"" franchise!",[],11.0,124.0,6.0,4.55,1.0,1.0,0.10428453146510851,1.0,0.1100949603054525,0.11107559953123808,0.10831046855784929,0.09731204935745233,0.10982059531366063,0.09229455779499648,0.10282811511006532,0.10068238318765146,1.0,0.08184551176190975,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

237715,13541596,Album Produced By...,eng,"In 1993, actor/writer/director Bruce Kimmel made another drastic life change and began a new journey, this time as a record producer. Within a year he became a hugely successful producer of musical theatre recordings, at a time when musical theatre recordings were not exactly high on anyone's popularity list. It was soon clear that Kimmel had a point of view, along with a dream that when people saw the credit ""Album Produced by Bruce Kimmel"" that it might actually mean something.
The story of that journey is peopled with an incredibly colorful cast of characters, including Stephen Sondheim, Lauren Bacall, Elaine Stritch, Dorothy Loudon, John Kander, Schmidt and Jones, Jerry Herman, Carol Channing, Petula Clark, Helen Reddy, and just about every great singer working back in what would be the last Golden Days of the record business. Kimmel produced cast albums (both Broadway and off-Broadway), gave new writers the chance to have their music recorded, new singers the chance to be heard, and made occasional best-selling forays into film music and jazz. From 1993 to 1999, when he and Varese Sarabande parted ways, he'd produced over 120 albums.
The next five years of his life would be a rollercoaster ride that most people would never want to take. He rides the ups, downs, curves, and thrills with humor, positivity, and perseverance. He creates a new and unique label, watches it crash and burn, and then rebuilds his life yet again, always fighting the good fight. As with There's Mel, There's Woody, and There's You, the first volume of his memoirs, Album Produced by... is filled with laughter, tears, joy, suspense, back-stabbing, broken promises, and above all, music--the grand and glorious music that Kimmel and company were able to bring forth.
You'll watch during the creation and recording of some of the most beloved musical theatre albums ever made. You'll meet not only the singers, but Kimmel's engineer, musical directors, arrangers, orchestrators, and musicians--an unlikely array of collaborators all led by Kimmel's vision, understanding, and sometimes insane passion. Written with warmth and humor, Album Produced by... is a look back at a remarkable career in the recording industry.",[],13.0,382.0,7.0,4.65,0.0929658454366803,0.09876619348982749,0.0871585945844146,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.10857880665503458,0.10419128742909838,0.0830857557776424,1.0,0.08524546146404566,0.12121270271023607,0.09296206594153242,0.05781474288717484,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
428614,557456,"The Philokalia, Volume 2: The Complete Text",eng,"The Philokaliais a collection of texts written between the fourth and the fifteenth centuries by spiritual masters of the Orthodox Christian tradition. First published in Greek in 1782, then translated into Slavonic and later into Russian, The Philokaliahas exercised an influence in the recent history of the Orthodox Church far greater than that of any book apart from the Bible. It is concerned with themes of universal importance: how man may develop his inner powers and awake from illusion; how he may overcome fragmentation and achieve spiritual wholeness; how he may attain the life of contemplative stillness and union with God.
Only a selection of texts from The Philokaliahas been available hitherto in English. The present rendering, which is a completely new translation, is designed to appear in five volumes. The first of these was published by Faber and Faber in 1979. The second volume consists mainly of writings from the seventh century, in particular by St. Maximus the Confessor, the greater part of which has never before been translated into English. As in the first volume, the editors have provided introductory notes to each of the writers, a glossary of key terms, and a detailed index.","['777635', '1083158', '590833', '395479', '1195059', '525740', '102122', '242655', '580622', '16088905', '302984', '2223353', '314159', '7042143', '82989', '242676', '242801', '132153']",237.0,416.0,7.0,4.59,0.07047978010348271,0.07247599552067761,0.06065695608819112,1.0,1.0,0.06881110033318245,0.07696078351950417,1.0,0.06472490104162489,0.06311334302749268,0.06357316823229409,1.0,0.06632032481117538,0.05045197134041203,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

These are some of the women who live along the banks of a river where water billows from caverns of silent lakes. None of them are famous. None of them have children.

Adria Idonea has always awakened from dreams of drowning. Throughout her childhood, Adria has awakened entangled in her linen sheets in her tower at her father's mountain citadel of Windberth. She has awakened within sweat-soaked furs as a young woman among the Aesidhe, the Wilding Ghosts of the deep wood. Adria has awakened far too many times between the water and the air, gasping for breath and grasping for... something already lost.
The dreams quickly fade, but the fear remains, for Adria's is a mind divided, a life in balance, heir of a nation on the brink of war.
In the wake of the War of Scars, Adria's father carved a kingdom out of the scattered settlements of fledgling nobles. He forged a faith from the ashes of old religions left smoldering beneath the boot heels of long-lost armies. Now, at last, Heiland is a realm of order, held in a balance as careful as the black and white of a king's chessboard. A perfect order, except for... a few ghosts.
The Aesidhe, now guided by Preinon, the exiled brother of King Ebenhardt Idonea, have become a challenge to the King of Heiland, to its Knights of Darkfire, and to the Matron of its Holy Sisterhood--a challenge made more potent by the unexpected arrival of a second great exile--young Princess Adria herself.
Now, the games of chess taught to her by her father begin to play out on a grand scale, in the past and the present of her life, as Adria fights for a place in her world true to the destiny of a princess and the heart of a Hunter of the Aesidhe. And even as she returns to the spires of Windberth to fulfill a promise to her brother Hafgrim, the newly knighted Prince of Heiland, she remains uncertain of her status--royal scion... or exiled traitor?
The War of Scars may have ended, but the legacy of shattered kingdoms and broken faiths has left the heirs of scars with an uncertain destiny in a fragile world. Torn between the legacy dictated by her father and the faith offered by her uncle and his new People, Adria knows that, as the Aesidhe have taught her, the mind divided can only defeat itself.
-The Heir of Scars I, Book One: Ghosts of Heiland-
At seventeen years of age, Adria Idonea has already seen both sides of war. Once princess in a citadel tower, almost storybook, she left to become a hunter, a healer, and a warrior among the enemy, in the deep wild of southern Heiland.
But a promise she made brings her once again to a choice. Who has she been? Who would she become?
Her way begins with a misstep, but Adria Idonea has learned to walk new paths before, guided by memories, shadows, and perhaps even ghosts.

Forward
Blessed are those, who are born as women. Is there any woman who would agree to this statement? No chance, because a woman doesn't realise herself. She doesn't try to perceive the spiritual power lying dormant within herself. Instead, she misconstrues materialism to be the real ways of life and hence spends her time fully immersed in materialistic pleasures, turning over and over, only the outer covers of the book called life. What she has to face and put up with, is a series of catastrophes. The heroine of this novel, Amminikkutty, was from a more or less good background, was kind hearted with pleasing manners and appearance. But it was the lack of one thing, God's favour and protection, which destroyed her life. Or was God purifying her by bestowing upon her, a life of continued misery to compensate the tribulations of her previous births? The readers can find solace only if they tune to such a line of thinking.
The story of Amminikkutty is the balance sheet of innumerable insults and unbelievable miseries which the women suffer in this society. The real face of a bigwig of society, who put on the outer mask of civility, is exposed in this novel. The sister in law who doesn't like to sacrifice her free, easy going ways of life at her mother's house even after getting married, together with her flirting husband make the heroine's life miserable still.
But still, she doesn't give in. She spends her life without troubling anybody, by ruminating in the sweet memories of the happy but short lived days of her past and dreaming of rejoining with her love.
The novelist, who was able to witness a life from near, narrates the story in an innate simple way, without putting in decorative tassels and fringes. But why?
Simply to see that at least little pathos are still remnant in human hearts from where kindness and tenderness are fast disappearing,
Simply to ensure and caution ourselves that we are not given to the bad, cruel ways like the personages of this story.
Simply to shed a drop of tear to perform oblation of the manes to the numerous women who still bear the burden of miserable lives and
Simply to pray for them.
Let Miss.Deepa be able to contribute further stories of this genre, which will expose the true lives of women of our society behind their false masks.

Translator's note
When Author (D.J) approached me for getting the translation done, I was expecting a contemporary novel matching with the life and style of new generation. But I was quite surprised to find that the starting point of the story dates to pre independence era, 1940's to be precise. Of course it ends up in the current era itself.
When the author mentioned that the story is based on a real life incident, I was all the more astonished. How can a human being endure such agonising hardships and that too all throughout her life? Mathematically, the life of the heroine can be equated to 'hardships personified'. It was a few broadminded people, and not her close kins, who arranged her stay at a geriatric home thereby helping her to lead a peaceful life at least during the last years of her life.
As my temperament goes, I'm all for the women who boldly face adverse situations and succeed in their lives. But this novel, being based on a real life incident, happened to be an eye opener to me. There were lots and lots of women who could not raise even their little fingers against the atrocities done against them. It was a highly male dominated male chauvinistic society which decided what women should, do and not do. They used to bully the women and overpower them by their physical superiority. Also, only the silent sufferers of the women community, and not the revolting type, who were admired and termed as 'pious and good women' during those times. Again it was a society set norm which even the women folk followed blindly! The narrations about the heroine Amminikkutty being physically and mentally tortured by her aged husband was real heart-rending. I do bow before her will power which did not succumb to escapist attitude like committing suicide.
Let me quote a line from the book-""Luck had been eluding her all throughout her life."" Yes, true, a very pious man had wedded her, but it lasted only five days. At her aged second husband's household, the son born to his first wife bolted out of the blue once and I hoped he would be her saviour. No, nothing happened; he also could not help her. But why? A big question, to which none can ever furnish a convincing proper answer. So, we the common people have no choice other than blaming the sins done or rather which we happened to do, in our previous births! Yes, when logic fails, on what else should we bank upon, other than our 'destiny'?
The story is all the more relevant now, since abandoning aged parents ruthlessly has become the rule of the day now. Even Kerala, the most literate state of India is not an exception to this crude brutal act. The gen-next may have their own justification for their acts, but throwing the parents away at the mercy of others can never be forgiven. Government controlled, neat, professionally managed geriatric homes can serve as a home away from home for the respected senior citizens, I feel. They will be safer and happier there among friends of the same age group than left alone or at the mercy of unreliable home maids/ nurses at lonely households.

Set in 1940s Florida, Middle America, Hollywood in the 70s, curious netherspheres between life and death, and deep inside the imaginations of characters whose greatest abundances are their emotions, the ten stories in Cummings's eclectic collection ORPHANS evoke familiar and strange scenarios of love and loss, heartbreak and humor, spirituality and sexuality, and the quelling of violence.
An unhappy housewife mired by the ravages of war fantasizes about killing her own daughter. An unlikely couple in the heart of Americana is brought together by strange sparks of magic trapped in a horoscopes column. The dark but achingly honest confessions of a Hollywood icon's emotionally deranged son cause him to band together with like-minded misfits. A play about a sweet, sickly little boy illuminates a weird world of living, corporeal dolls that gently dance him to his imminent death. And there is more.

""Truth Heals the Heart"" will show you a romance that even prison can't stop. Our characters have managed to overcome the obstacles of their pasts, but can't seem to move on with their futures. Secrets have been discovered, secrets are still being kept. They're trapped in the bonds of the law. Although the guilty has repented, the sentence can't be reprieved. Treason is the unforgivable act and Alexander has done the unforgivable. Lady Penelope has won his heart, but will he be able to win his freedom. It's a game of give and take, wanting and can't having, having and not knowing how to take hold of it. If only the prison bars were not in the equation. While Markus and Katrina fight their own emotions and desires, they are trapped as well, helpless to do anything about it. Meanwhile life goes on, babies are born, time passes, love grows stronger, people change and no one can figure out how to bring it all together. Some secrets remain and are so deeply hidden, there's only one person left alive that can reveal the truth.

- Questions and prompts to help you make personal connections to each card;
