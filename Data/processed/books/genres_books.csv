When newlyweds Miriam and Daniel didn't return home from France as scheduled, Miriam's mother, Ann, knew something terrible must have happened.. The young couple had already boarded the plane home when officers removed them from their seats and returned them to the airport, assuring them, ""This is just routine."" Opening a suitcase that a trusted ""friend"" had begged them to take, they were horrified to discover a cache of contraband drugs. Although they desperately tried to explain their innocence, they were immediately arrested and prevented from contacting anyone.. Miriam, who was expecting her first child, was thrown into a rigid and foreign prison, while Daniel was incarcerated in a different facility on the other side of town, both barred from contacting family, lawyers, or each other.. It was a living nightmare, the kind you never want to face; the kind you can't wake up from. After days of anguish and worry, Ann rushed to Paris to negotiate the French legal system and offer support to her daughter and son-in-law, shuttling back and forth between the two prisons in her attempts to encourage and uplift the frightened young couple.. Behind Prison Walls is the true story of Miriam's harrowing experience, seen through her daily letters to her family. As she sits alone in her prison cell, she chronicles her struggles to obtain kosher food, keep her terror at bay, and daven fervently for release before her baby is born. Miriam's compassion for others and firm emunah fortify her throughout her ordeal, but her mother, reading between the lines, interprets the terror behind her seemingly mundane musings.. Now being told for the first time after years of silence, Behind Prison Walls is the riveting account of one family's agonizing trial.

Khan's dangerous nuclear forays. Even while analyzing Pakistan's present-day plunge into internal dissent, self-made jihadi extremism, provincial rivalry and military rule, Verghese offers a gentle way out of the nation's self-made dilemmas - by encouraging Pakistan to become more than the Indian 'other', and urging it to move away from fundamentalism and embrace the syncretic, Sufi-infused Islam it once knew.

52170,30049357,Five Hundred Words For Snow,eng,"Five Hundred Words For Snowis a collection of both prize-winning and unpublished short stories by the author Ceri A. Lowe, charting the journey through childhood to becoming an adult. It is about the half-truths and lies we tell ourselves and each other every day. Set in an eclectic range of locations from Neath through New Orleans and beyond, each story focuses on a different element of the emotions we experience through childhood and the profound impact tiny events can have upon us as adults.
With influences from Poland, Lithuania and the USA amongst others, each story illustrates how our own journeys can be unravelled in a lightening flash - through one white lie or a misunderstanding and change the course of a lifetime, for ever.
Covering themes that span abandonment, childhood death, guilt, love, 911, ASD, betrayal and the intrinsic nature of human hope, each story is carefully crafted to question the fabric of how we live and how we view and judge those around us.","['29964269', '27986676', '17227710', '18629730', '29011829', '29930577', '30170502', '28594736', '17728989', '28634757', '28869025', '29619326', '34100995', '29939689']",0.0,128.0,1.0,0.0,0.12030772663611215,0.12711219398725856,0.11291053787325296,1.0,1.0,0.13604787098745583,0.14497591293772696,1.0,0.11570671120895001,0.13035798410457686,0.1175504688546251,1.0,0.11083412721654497,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

As it flows through Highland Perthshire and cuts through fertile straths and valleys on its way, a memorable picture of Scotland in microcosm emerges.

In the latter half of the eighteenth century the suffering of sick animals in this country resulting from the gross ignorance of the farriers and other quacks in whose care they were put was causing grave concern. But although many persons pondered on this state of affairs and realized that it arose mainly from a lack of scientific education in animal medicine, little attempt was made to remedy the evil until it attracted the attention of a small agricultural society in the village of Odiham in Hampshire. It is with the activities of these men that this story is largely concerned. They were not daunted by any difficulty. Their enterprise prospered and in 1791 their efforts culminated in the founding of the first Veterinary School in Great Britain.
The transition from the crudities and cruelties of 'farriery witchcraft' to the first years of veterinary education was accomplished in about a decade, a remarkable achievement in view of the prejudices and problems involved; it took, however, another fifty years before the veterinary profession was officially recognized by Royal Charter in 1844.",[],0.0,178.0,1.0,0.0,0.06116275519175869,0.06719842993507687,0.05680283790839475,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.06890441085204341,1.0,0.06417302995276514,0.05975266418099126,0.05920480715850107,0.07445778728078487,0.053653891246905186,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Use it first to increase self-understanding, then to create harmony between the inner world of self and outer world of others. The text maps the natural patterns of change which trigger predictable passages from one stage to another in our lives. Its simple observations are a treasure of enduring practical wisdom. Its purpose is to maintain poise and stability in the midst of change. Using the interactive Book of Change is a powerful way to get in touch with the native common sense we're all born with, but too often forget under the pressures of hectic daily life. The I Ching codifies the dynamics of natural law, sometimes called the Law of Karma. As such, it is the functional foundation of practical ethics. Careful thinkers everywhere consult it as the basis for a realistic philosophy of life. Psychologists and therapists turn to it for its profound insights into the dynamics of the human psyche and personal relationships. Leaders and strategists study it to understand themselves, their followers and opponents, and then make effective decisions. Based on the timeless Positive Paradigm of Change rediscovered by Einstein in the 20th century, it gives new meaning to the natural law Tom Paine invoked in his appeal to Common Sense.

122998,22551104,Forty-Six Meditations: for the Thinking Chief Executive,eng,"As I look back over my experiences, the ones that I value above all are the times when I was able to help others. My fondest memories are of those times when a CEO faced a challenge that was truly daunting and was, with my help, able to overcome that challenge and grow in capability and understanding far beyond what they thought they were capable of. In a real sense, these books are written for those leaders who find themselves in similar situations - facing challenges that they are not sure they can overcome. The message that I very much want to communicate is 'Yes, you can overcome. Yes you can grow in mastery, understanding and knowledge. You can become so much more than you are.""
This first volume is written as a series of 'thinking pieces'. Although there is an overall plan for the book, each chapter is designed to bring an issue into high relief and to help the reader get their mind around both the challenge and the way forward. I expect that you will find some of the chapters somewhat obscure at first but I urge you to persevere. No complex issue is mastered by a simple reading of a chapter or two. It takes thinking - reflection - living with new ideas - before some yield and real growth is possible.
We have all had the experience. Sometimes it takes weeks, months or even years to digest important lessons. Recently I finally came to understand something that a mentor had tried to teach me more than a decade ago.
For what it is worth, I suggest that you resist the temptation to 'blow through the book'. At the core of each chapter is a suggestion that will lead you to reconsider how you have been approaching a particular challenge and how you might change your behavior, approach and understanding so as to master it. Impatience carries a terrible cost when it comes to such changes in behaviors.
The time you spend thinking about each chapter will prove much more valuable than the brief time you spend reading it.
The intent of this series is to give you the beginnings of insights - set you on the path that will result in your growth and mastery - open up the potential that has always resided within you. Be true to that project and our partnership will yield benefits far beyond your expectations.",[],0.0,216.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.11495555825295664,0.11497025891942633,0.13059987868117676,1.0,1.0,0.1101549178359005,0.11114623038534562,0.10276785963267399,0.10744749079509722,0.12803796756606478,0.0797139848399691,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

141948,23293790,Views from the Learning Post,eng,"Introduction: Becoming a columnist for the Grass & Grain was not in my retirement plans; it just happened. When my wife asked me to write something to include in our annual Christmas letter, I sat down to write and came up with some very short essays. She typed them and mailed them with our Christmas cards, one of which went to Frank Buchman, of Grass & Grain. A short time later, Frank came to see me (the author) to ask if he could print the essays in the paper and also asked me to consider continuing with a weekly article. Thus, the ""Learning Post"" column was born. I thought perhaps I could keep it going for a few weeks or months. It will soon be sixteen years and I am still writing...
This year (2007) I decided it was time to publish a collection of the stories. The big job has been in deciding which ones to include that will be of most interest to the readers. By waiting this long, it has meant sorting through about eight hundred of them, hoping to make the right selections.

""Someday they'll go down together / they'll bury them side by side. / To few it'll be grief / To the law a relief / But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.""
The story of America's most infamous crime spree told in the raw and honest voice of the woman who lived it, Bonnie Parker.
Texas: 1931. Bonnie Parker's dreams of the limelight and a white picket fence are on hold. She's a waitress in Dallas, endlessly writing letters to the governor pleading for the release of the man she loves: a reckless, quick-smiling boy named Clyde Barrow, sentenced to fourteen years at the notorious Eastham prison farm.
When Clyde is paroled early, Bonnie thinks their life is about to really begin. But Clyde has changed in prison. Distant, damaged, and dogged by the cops, he knows it's only a matter of time before the law tries to lock him up again. That's not something he or Bonnie can bear. When he's fired from his job--and now breaking parole--he decides to make a run for it. Leave Texas. Get enough cash to make a fresh start in a new state. And, of course, he wants his beloved Bonnie to come with him.
It's just one stolen car. One robbed bank. Then, they can have the life they always wanted. Or so they think, as they set out.

Jake Black is almost your average teen, fresh from the high-school farm he jumps at the chance to move from Hobart to Adelaide, with the vague plan of taking engineering at the University. Like many people of his generation who travel from home, he turns to Facebook as a medium to pass on news and keep in touch with family and friends. If only his mother wouldn't call him every day to check on his diabetes. Or use his sister's account to spy on his activities. Perhaps this is why his parents were so eager for him to attend one of the city's residential colleges, where he is surrounded by 200 students who can keep watch.
However college is more adventurous than Jake's parents bargained for. From his first 'ponding' in the courtyard fountain to forced o-week activities such as Goon of Fortune, and being dropped 30km from the city wearing nothing but a g-string and body paint, Jake plunges into college life with the enthusiasm of one finally release from the parental blanket.
Ignoring the inevitable medical impacts of his new life style Jake struggles managing his mother and his new freedom with mixed results on the public Facebook platform.

Following the popularity of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol(1843), Victorian newspapers and magazines frequently featured ghost stories at Christmas time, and reading them by candlelight or the fireside became an annual tradition. This second volume of Victorian Christmas ghost stories contains fifteen tales, most of which have never been reprinted. They represent a mix of the diverse styles and themes common to Victorian ghost fiction and include works by once-popular authors like Grant Allen and Eliza Lynn Linton as well as contributions from anonymous or wholly forgotten writers. This volume also features a new introduction by Prof. Allen Grove.

Additives are a part of modern food life and they're not all bad. Despite our best intentions, we can't always eat fresh and to make food safe, stable and taste good, we need a few additives. But which ones? This eBook tells you.
This eBook explores the notion that cooking does similar things to processing, whether drying, salting, pickling, canning or freezing.
It outlines the 23 classes of additives in use and shows you how to find them on food labels. It lists those that are harmless or that you're probably already consuming such as citric acid 330 (found in lemons and all citrus fruits) or magnesium sulphate 518, better known as Epsom salt that you add to a bath to soak in.
It also lists those to steer clear of that have long been a problem such as the colours, preservatives and flavour enhancers. There's a handy list of the 18 suspicious additives for you to bookmark or print and keep when out shopping.
It finishes with a 4-step plan to avoid ALL additives if you still think you need to and describes the trend to ""Clean Labels"" that manufacturers are now adopting.
Drawing on her own experiences as a dietitian, educator and industry consultant, Catherine guides readers logically through the maze of information that is on any food label. She simplifies and makes it interesting and memorable. Through everyday examples (The ""Inside Story""), she brings additives to life and shows the roles they play to keep food safe and fresh.",[],0.0,68.0,1.0,0.0,0.057365243669102034,0.05325035139009685,0.05897816164007787,1.0,1.0,0.05895512191003341,0.05762261199673159,0.060275828037622894,0.05373266809056448,1.0,0.05371882930920054,1.0,0.04034524134488725,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Introduction:
""York had two main, central, bridges in the medieval period: one over the Ouse and one over the Foss. There were also three other bridges over the Foss leading out of the town or lying outside it -- Castle Mills Bridge, Monk Bridge and Layerthorpe Bridge -- but these are not the subject of this work. It is not known when Ouse Bridge and Foss Bridge were built, but the earliest documentary reference to Ouse Bridge is in a charter of 1189 x 1200, and to Foss Bridge in 1145 x 1148 in the Cartulary of Whitby (EYC 1, 176; 2, 218). The wardens of Ouse Bridge are first mentioned in the cartulary of Fountains Abbey: Albreda, the widow of Walter de Acum, gave a plot of land in Little Bretegate to the Abbey, with the permission of the wardens of Ouse Bridge. Albreda also sold a plot of land to Nigel, father of Agnes, who also gave a plot of land to the Abbey. The latter gift was witnessed by Hugh de Selby, then mayor of York. He was mayor of York intermittently during the period 1217 to 1235, so that the first gift by Albreda presumably dates from this time (Lancaster 1915 1, 269-70). The wardens of Foss Bridge are not mentioned separately at this time, nor are the functions of the bridgemasters.""",[],0.0,486.0,1.0,0.0,0.07001976514959246,0.06850723455163078,0.06560494564192057,1.0,1.0,0.07155060941443676,0.07062740187223421,1.0,0.05841595968110359,0.06737758991497951,0.057249563393095525,1.0,0.048846304344403554,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Supported by the Flemish Action Program for Biotechnology - This paper examines the determinants of researcher contribution-spans. The contribution-span is the number of years spanning a researcher's first and last known publications in afield. As a consequence, it serves as a unique and useful measure of researchers' persistence in afield. Based on co-authorship data, several sociometric indices are created and their impact on researchers' persistence in their efforts to develop a technology is examined. Evidence is provided from 2,876 researchers active in the field of transgene plants over eleven-years. The findings lend support to the proposition that an individual researcher's network position is an important determinant of his or her persistence in the development of a new technology.

This is my 41st book - I have written a lot about my Late Father (PBUH) in all my columns writings and books - and, therefore, it was quite easy to write this book!
The East Africans - especially in Mafia Island in Tanzania well knew him as The Angry Arab!
A Great Personality of rich history between continents - and came and went - and after more than 15 children - grandchildren and great grandchildren!
Born in Oman and went to East Africa at age of 25 with his first children (boy 7 and girl 5) in that dhow (sailing boat) and return decades later after the bloody Zanzibar Revolution of 12th January 1964.
A simple pious person who knew great personalities in his life but chose to remain on his own - contented proud and satisfied - and to Allah God only he turned his prayers and needs!
A very handsome person who never chased girls - who never drank nor smoked! A fining shining example to his children and grandchildren - family, friends and relatives - and The Society as a whole!
I hope you will like reading about him! Here is A Story To Tell!
May he and our Mother rest in eternal peace in this world and the next - and open the highest gates for Heaven for them - Amin Amen I have reproduced a few articles where my late parents are mentioned. Otherwise it will be a very big book!
A Great Personality who was not afraid in speaking The Truth! He should be read even more than the other books written about 'My Father' emphasis! He may not have been a Great Public Official - or Wastah Influence like them - or well-known like them too!
He was a person with Great History and A Story To Tell! For good of mankind and society! A Great Person Came - and he went! Born and bred in The Oman Interior - from Omani Parents and Grandparents - and he went and returned from Tanzania (Zanzibar) - it is what you are that makes you!

270529,26045020,Agent Human: Consciousness At The Service Of The Group,eng,"The book describes the development of consciousness in animals and humans, demonstrating its causes and utility in social behaviour, and particularly the group behaviour of primates and Homo sapiens. The book has 450 pages, with illustrations, tables, references and indices, aimed at the serious general reader and the academic market.
Agent Human is the first book which combines a rigorous treatment of the biological and behavioural underpinnings of consciousness with a comprehensive theory of human agency, thus allowing robust predictions of the future both of human society and of consciousness itself, the human species' greatest achievement.
Although the emergence of consciousness is initially described at an anatomical and neural level, supporting material is included to assist the general reader in understanding the technical details.
The human group, with its moral burden, was initially the means by which humans were able to develop society and culture; the process culminated in the emergence of the State, which is portrayed as a perversion of the natural, ethical 'groupishness' of humans. But the book shows how the Internet and the globalization of human society that it engenders will reclaim the moral high ground for individuals.
Individuality is seen as a social tool - self-awareness emerged to allow the 'Human Agent' to function effectively in a group, social setting. But our felt conscious awareness is detached from the workings of the underlying human psyche; at a conscious level, we often deceive ourselves and others, for once valid evolutionary reasons. By now this does more harm than good - but there is a way out!
Our self-awareness allows us to consider improving ourselves and the condition of the individual in society; and technology presents multiple opportunities for this. The book ends with an exploration of the future of consciousness, and by extension the future of people.
There are of course many books about consciousness, but they tend to focus on particular aspects: Texts which describe the neurological basis of consciousness - these are often impenetrable to the general reader; 'Dualist' approaches to the social, ethical and even religious dimensions of consciousness - these have largely been bypassed by cognitive science; Sociological or philosophical treatments of the behaviour of human beings - these hardly ever or never pay attention to the cognitive realities of the brain.
In general, existing books on consciousness fail to treat of the causes and purposes of consciousness, and so they are unable to construct a predictive theory of the future for consciousness. There are some honourable exceptions, but many of them were written years or even decades ago, and do not reflect modern cognitive scientific achievement.",[],0.0,500.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.07424167155019232,0.04758725585513007,1.0,0.05960166391170748,0.061556331610688665,1.0,0.06249626395882684,1.0,0.04433639494806767,0.05013904268027619,0.04800561289483685,0.04614237686580159,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

""Here is an analysis of the applied theological thought of John M. Frame. This is one book that looks behind the theory and projects the desired effects that Dr. Frame has sought to teach his seminary students. It is not enough to learn doctrinal or philosophical theory, one must learn how to apply that theology into every area of life. This introduction to Dr. Frame's practical theology should be read by every pastor, student, and layman. Grab the vision and build the kingdom!""

In a certain sense, Franklin did nevertheless go to Italy. One way or another, he left his imprint upon numerous Italian contemporaries--scientists, philosophers, diplomats, printers, and men of letters. Later his shadow as statesman and moralist fell unmistakably upon the Risorgimento--the great current of forces and events that produced a free and united Italy. At the same time literature and the fine arts attest how intimately Franklin entered into the warp and woof of Italian life and dreams. There is evidence, also, that he was not been forgotten in more recent years.
This unexpectedly rich chapter in international cultural relations vindicates forcibly, and opportunely, the reality of the historic American contribution to world civilization.

This book is told in short episodes. This is Book 7 Attack!
Growing Pains of a Teenage Werewolf 7 Attack!
Blood will have blood. Romeo and Juliet. Two teenagers madly in love.
Growing Pains of a Teenage Werewolf follows two adolescents madly in love facing the usual problems of growing up. Young love never burned so bright, so beautiful or so dangerously. Think of Romeo and Juliet but with a difference.
Mark is desperately trying to make love to Mercedes without turning into a werewolf or coming too soon. They are interrupted by the horrific appearance of Nostro Pellegrino.
Here is a short extract from Book 7 Attack!
Standing staring at them with a demonic grin on his evil face was the tall figure of Nostro Pellegrino.
In a flash Pellegrino was at the side of the bed leering lasciviously at the naked and voluptuous Mercedes.
""Well, well, what have we here?"" His eyes bored into Mercedes as Mark scrabbled across the floor to pick up the cross. The Vampire kicked it under the bed before he could get his hands on it.
Ani rattled helplessly at the bedroom door. ""What's happened? Open the door, Mercy. Please! Are you all right?""
Mark looked around desperately. What could he use? He lunged for a jar of cream on Mercedes' dressing table and swung it viciously at Pellegrino's head. Pellegrino saw it late but still was quick enough to dodge most of the blow as it glanced off the side of his head.
It was enough to momentarily distract him. Mercedes ran for the door and unlocked it. Ani rushed in and stared in horror at the scene in front of her.
The vampire now had Mark by the throat and was preparing to bite him.
""Leave him. Look at me. Don't you find me desirable?"" Mercedes thrust her magnificent chest in Pellegrino's face at the same time pointing her foot to where the edge of the cross protruded from the bed.
Ani reached down and grasped the cross as Pellegrino's attention focused on Mercedes' breasts. He pushed out a hand to grasp her right breast.
""Grab them both, you dirty man,"" Mercedes shouted.
The vampire grinned and released his hold of Mark's throat to concentrate on fondling the young girl's breasts.
Mark fell to the floor gasping and choking, fighting for breath.
Suddenly Pellegrino staggered back as Ani thrust the cross burning in her hands into the vampire's face.
""Aargh!"" it screamed and fell backwards out of the window the burning cross firmly lodged in its left eye.
They rushed to the window just in time to see the creature slide over the fence into the darkness.
Growing Pains of a Teenage Werewolf is both a realistic portrayal of teenagers in love and a heart pounding chiller of a horror thriller romance. On top of the ever present problem of making love between Mark and Mercedes there is the threat from Nostro and Silvano Pellegrino who are bent on killing Mark and Mercedes. Mercedes' modelling and Mark's football trial are also due soon.
Growing Pains of a Teenage Werewolf breaks the mould of the conventional paranormal romance.

341050,9898498,"The Heart of Russia: Trinity-Sergius, Monasticism, and Society After 1825",en-GB,"In the 1830s and 1840s, increasing numbers of Russians renounced the modernized, secularized, Westernized Russia created by Peter the Great in an effort to revive alternative lifestyles based on Orthodox spirituality and values. This effort found expression in a revival of monasticism that began in the era of Nicholas I and would last for the duration of the imperial period, brought to an end only by the cataclysm of revolution and repression of the new Bolshevik regime. Suppressed by the communists, Russian monasticism experienced another revival in the post-World War II era and again in the post-Soviet period, demonstrating that the impulse to renounce the contemporary world for the cloister is a central pattern of Russian religiosity. This book is the first comprehensive analysis of these monastic revivals, presenting a fundamentally new picture of religion in modern Russia. Scott Kenworthy's approach is that of a contextualized microhistory: an in-depth study of one monastic complex, framed within research on monasticism more broadly. The case study here is Russia's largest and most famous monastery, the Trinity-Sergius Lavra in Sergiev Posad, near Moscow. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Orthodox Church is again experiencing a revival, and monasticism is playing a central role in this resurgence. In the search to recover the past, Russian Orthodox are turning to the nineteenth century revival as a normative model. Numerous Russians are once again renouncing the contemporary world--in this case, both the socialist past and the post-socialist capitalist present--and opting for a mode of life that represents a return to past values. Monasteries are again foci of popular piety as well as of important publishing activities, and their spirituality is regarded as the purest expression of Orthodox ideals. This book provides an essential basis for understanding Orthodoxy in its historical context and its contemporary manifestations.",[],0.0,544.0,1.0,0.0,0.10336135349053789,1.0,0.07961986415042409,1.0,0.1027635643682775,0.08973454417369654,0.10134423754356138,1.0,0.07310586659283182,0.07903185287541693,0.08369061004428467,0.08874108054050699,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

371947,27157640,Foundations of Practical Sorcery - Collected Works,eng,"A seven volume set of magical treatises, presented in this Collected Works, unabridged, being: Vol. I - Liber Noctis (A Handbook of the Sorcerous Arte) Liber Noctis explores the attitudes, training and preparation required for success in ritual, and, as the title suggests, does not shy away from the 'darker' aspects of magic. Practical, experiential, lucid and non-judgmental, this book lays the groundwork for the successful study and practice of sorcery in the modern world. Vol. II - Ars Salomonis (Being of that Hidden Arte of Solomon the King) Ars Salomonis is a practical manual for working with the talismanic figures found in the Key of Solomon, the most significant of all grimoires. Including two methods for empowering and activating the planetary pentacles, the author makes this vital work safely accessible to beginners. It is an ideal entranceway into the grimoire tradition. Vol. III - Ars Geomantica (Being an account and rendition of the Arte of Geomantic Divination and Magic) Ars Geomantica explores the medieval system of Geomancy, one of the simplest and most practical of the divinatory arts. The inclusion of detailed instructions on the creation of geomantic staves, elemental fluid condensers, and talismanic construction and consecration make this work a superb introduction to the extensive assortment of magical and divinatory principles. Vol. IV - Ars Theurgia Goetia (Being an account and rendition of the arte and praxis of the conjuration of some of the spirits of Solomon) Ars Theurgia Goetia presents a precise and practical guide to working with the spirits of this neglected text from the Solomonic grimoire cycle, the Theurgia-Goetia, giving the full seals of the spirits for the first time. The complete ritual sequence of preparation, conjuration, and license to depart is lucidly demonstrated, making this work suitable for both the beginner and the experienced practitioner. Vol. V - Otz Chim (The Tree of Life) Otz Chim is a practical exploration of the magic of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, the glyph that concentrates the essence of magic and mysticism within the Western Mystery Tradition. This book focuses on lesser-known aspects such as the angels associated with the paths, their seals, and invocations and includes the previously unavailable Massa Aborum Vitae. Vol. VI - Ars Speculum (Being an instruction on the arte of using mirrors and shewstones in magic) Ars Speculum is a concise and practical work on the use of mirrors and shewstones in magic. In it the author explores skrying and working with the four elements of air, fire, water and earth - both with elemental condensers and different elemental creatures. Other techniques include contacting other levels of being, the conjuration of spirits, binding and ligature, and healing and protection. Vol. VII - Liber Terriblis (Being an instruction on the seventy-two spirits of the Goetia) Liber Terribilis is a practical study of how to work with the seventy-two spirits of the infamous seventeenth-century Grimoire, the Goetia. It also explores the vital and often neglected use of the seventy-two binding angels of the Great Name of God, the Schemhamphorasch. This volume will be of value to all levels of students and practitioners of the grimoire traditions, being based upon the work of a small group of occultists who have explored it in practice.

381217,10083041,Freedom Readers: The African American Reception of Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedy,en-US,"Freedom Readers: The African American Reception of Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedyis a literary-historical study of the many surprising ways in which Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedyhave assumed a position of importance in African American culture. Dennis Looney examines how African American authors have read, interpreted, and responded to Dante and his work from the late 1820s to the present.
In many ways, the African American reception of Dante follows a recognizable narrative of reception: the Romantic rehabilitation of the author; the late-nineteenth-century glorification of Dante as a radical writer of reform; the twentieth-century modernist rewriting; and the adaptation of the Divine Comedyinto the prose of the contemporary novel. But surely it is unique to African American rewritings of Dante to suggest that the Divine Comedyis itself a kind of slave narrative. Only African American ""translations"" of Dante use the medieval author to comment on segregation, migration, and integration. While many authors over the centuries have learned to articulate a new kind of poetry from Dante's example, for African American authors attuned to the complexities of Dante's hybrid vernacular, his poetic language becomes a model for creative expression that juxtaposes and blends classical notes and the vernacular counterpoint in striking ways. Looney demonstrates this appropriation of Dante as a locus for black agency in the creative work of such authors as William Wells Brown, the poet H. Cordelia Ray, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, Gloria Naylor, Toni Morrison, and the filmmaker Spencer Williams.",[],0.0,296.0,1.0,0.0,0.05887711063717834,0.06072065747231821,0.04811575961248602,1.0,1.0,0.0499024054894686,0.05064234751580124,1.0,0.046084979371625014,0.05574492584332319,0.0489667332462294,0.06092532078257556,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

400425,26044965,The Futures Of The Human Race,eng,"'Futures Of The Human Race' is a startling analysis of the interaction of artificial intelligence, the Internet, brain implants and virtual reality with globalization and the evolved human psyche.
The book delivers an optimistic message: that modern computer technology, especially in the form of the Internet, and globalization - these two in fact can hardly be separated - will reclaim major expanses of human endeavour for the direct involvement of people, largely bypassing the nation state.
Book One, 'Globalization', sketches the detail of this process, already surprisingly far advanced, under the five headings of Economics, Culture, Taxation, the Law and Politics. The final chapter of Book One is devoted to the Internet. It shows that the process is both unstoppable, short of a major catastrophe, and desirable.
Globalization is conventionally viewed, especially by its opponents, as nationalism or capitalism writ large. On the contrary, the chapters in this part of the book portray globalization, accompanied by the Internet, as undermining the faceless power of the State, while enabling human beings to take advantage of their affiliative natures to develop a vast range of truly democratic and participative international organizations.
One cautionary note is in order: inevitably, the book is written from the perspective of a citizen of a 'developed' country. Yet a high proportion of humanity lives in 'undeveloped', even outright poverty-stricken regions. The chapters devoted to globalization must obviously be taken as applying to the developed world. It would be ludicrous to suggest that a subsistence farmer on an African plain can share in the pleasures and pains of a globalized life.
However, this is a short-term problem (not for 2007's unfortunate subsistence farmer, of course). As later parts of the book will show, the next fifty years will see abundant economic growth and a series of 'boot-strapping' initiatives directed at less fortunate parts of the world which will level up the playing field to such an extent that by 2050 poverty will be largely a thing of the past, and a very high proportion of humanity will be able to participate in the globalized world described in this book.
Book Two tracks the future of major human institutions such as the nation state and language as perfect, real-time translation, electricity-generating forests, robot pets, an Olympics for bionic people, access to the human subconscious, the end of compulsory work, electronic human clones and collective cognitive meeting spaces have their effect.
Book Three is a futuristic imaginary journey through the whole of the 21st century and beyond, building on the trends and advances mapped out in Book Two to create a vision of a very different, but still human world at the beginning of the 22nd century.",[],0.0,479.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.12277687272035895,1.0,0.15286810191458003,0.1494922794548104,1.0,0.14780391254878775,0.14370681314515985,0.11385085426241164,0.12257767837073125,0.13375866888272986,0.11208606325170006,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Just as the old saying goes, ""An old building needs to be demolished before a new one can be erected in its place,"" there will be no construction without destruction. The commencement of the dismantling of the old monetary system is also the beginning of the construction of the new one. Contrary to Western rhetoric, which portrays China as part of the cause of the recent financial crisis, the author contends that China is actually a victim of the current unjust international economic and monetary system. To address the imbalance and break the dollar-dominated international monetary system, the author calls for the internationalization of the Renminbi and diversification of the international monetary system. Written by one of the foremost financial practitioners in China, this book is thought-provoking and provides a unique Chinese perspective on how the international monetary system should be reformed, what the future system should look like and the role China should play in the process.

As he floated along in the void of the Subspace surrounded by darkness and swirling purple and blue colors, he reflected on the disastrous end of the battle.
Master Hand had shown up right before Tabuu could terminate the big group of Smashers. As a last ditch attempt, the omnipotent hand used his space-bending powers to recall each one of the Smashers to their worlds, back into the past before they participated in the Brawl tourney and the war against the Subspace Army. He then called Crazy Hand, and both of them escaped from Tabuu's clutches, effectually putting a sudden end to the conflict for the time being...
Unfortunately, not everything was right.

The longest work of fiction ever written is based of the Story Mode of Super Smash Bros: Brawl. It is called the Subspace Emissary's Worlds Conquest and it's nearly 4 million words long. That's 13 times longer than James Joyce's novel 'Ulysses'. It was written by a 22-year-old called Christian. He is from Arizona and started writing it the day Super Smash Bros.

Many of Heather Reyes's short stories share a connection with paintings (and painting titles) by Paul Klee, Matisse and Kandinsky. Full of verve, wit and intimacy, her superbly quirky, mischievous and colour-filled stories show how our daily lives are richer, stranger and more dangerous than we know.
Why is Genghis Khan on little Eva's bed? Who painted 'Only connect' on the Ritz? What does a gargoyle have to say about the world? Did Mr Davidsbundler really come to call? In the world of Heather Reyes Talking it over with Genghis Khan the answers are as unexpected as the questions.
Her short stories have appeared in many UK and US literary magazines including Fiction International, Ambit, Philosophy Now and Mslexia.

An interview with the author
The first thing that stands out about the collection is that it's flooded with colour. There are only a handful of stories that don't feature colour in an important way and many of them use colour in the title.
The stories are hugely varied in form and length, but colour provides a unifying element. The few that don't use colour directly are nevertheless linked to the colour element and what it stands for in the other stories. For example, 'Looking for Little Miss Universe' pits joy and humour against the sadness of human mortality, and that's very much in line with some of what I'm trying to do elsewhere in the more obviously 'colour-full' stories.
Quite a number of the colours you use aren't what I'd call 'straightforward' ones. They're very specific tones - like 'reseda', 'magenta', 'saffron', 'periwinkle'.
I've always been fascinated by the names of colours. It must go back to seeing the names on my grandfather's the oil paints when I was a child. I use this detail very directly in 'After uranium' where they're in contrast to the stories the old man tells the little girl about war. Thematically, it's part of my attempt to foreground the different, the rich, and the unexpected, and making the tales visually interesting, too - and more precise than, say, 'red' or 'green' or 'blue', which would be a bit boring. And, of course, in 'A grandmother's green should be reseda', the contrast between the two different shades of green is very significant - the granddaughter wanting her to be a dignified 'reseda' while the grandmother's real character and her hidden past is expressed through her preference for 'emerald' - which the girl comes to understand in the course of the story. The colour names are also linked with my love of playing with the sounds of words.
Perhaps we can talk about the 'playing with the sounds of words' in a minute. But I wonder if you'd like to say a bit more about the way colour - and even individual colours - function in the stories.
For me, colour - along with music - is one of the greatest sources of joy in life and, even in sad or serious stories, I usually try to retrieve or create something positive: I hope the foregrounding of colour helps to achieve this. In 'The colour of '33' we go with the narrator and the man she loves to an exhibition of Kandinsky's work. Among all the wonderfully coloured paintings, there's one small, uncoloured one called 'Grim situation' - which only makes sense when you read the date, 1933, and know it was the year Hitler became Chancellor. His regime persecuted the Bauhaus artists, of which Kandinsky was one. This stands for the whole history of that ghastly period, and the narrator can only escape it by 'entering' a painting that's full of healing colour. In 'One magenta sock' the colour becomes an enrichment of life and is associated with a creative and unusual person. In some stories, colour is set against 'no colour': in 'Come back, Lapis Lazuli, all is forgiven', that rich blue is set against 'maggot-colour'; saffron is set against grey in 'Remembering saffron'; lavender against conventional white in 'The lavender bride', and so on.
Do you have a favourite colour?
Don't laugh - it's actually pale grey ... But maybe partly because against it you can put just about any of the glorious colours that exist and they are both enhanced. In terms of the sound of a particular colour, I think maybe 'lapis lazuli' - it has those gentle, lapping 'els' and the zippy, energetic 'z' near the middle.
The collection ends with a string of little stories that hardly seem stories at all, in the conventional sense.
Ah, but what the reader has to do is construct or be aware of the 'big' stories behind them! 'The lavender bride' isn't just a few lines about a young woman who wears a lavender wedding dress. It suggests the whole history of women being made to conform to certain ideas of 'purity' etc. The young woman in the story defies convention - and in doing so sets a valuable example to others, freeing their imagination to be themselves and not cow-tow to others' ideas of what she should be. These small stories are exercises in 'condensation', if you like, and the reader does sometimes have to work a bit harder at them.
Religion crops up in various stories. The title story actually starts with the sentence, 'When Eva first learned about wars and things, she thought she'd better start going to church - just in case.' She's heard that God is supposed to answer prayers. Yet you're not really a 'believer' in the conventional sense.
No, but I was educated at a wonderful convent school so religion is part of my 'imaginative universe'. What I've tried to do in various stories is recuperate some of the richness of religious imagery and put it to use in a new way, but still with an 'altruistic' intent - a route to a more worldly salvation, if you like. Of course, in the title story the girl's naivety is partly a critique of certain religious attitudes in the face of the overwhelming suffering inflicted by powerful war-mongers, here represented by Genghis Khan and Hitler. At the end of the story, the girl engages the help of two religious statues - man-made 'art works', even if rather 'plastery-looking' ones. They appear to come to life, throw aside the trappings of religious iconography and follow the girl out of the church and into the world - as statues. It's tied up with the girl's attempt to start a fashion for replacing the word 'rebirth' with 'Renaissance' - which evokes a blossoming of Humanism and interest in the products of Man's cultural life, as well as 'nicer clothes' than the other option, 'Resurrection', which, as the girl muses, only suggests dusty old blood-stained sheets.
In 'Campaign for more topaz', the speaker takes the idea of the Seven Deadly Sins and proposes seven new ones to replace them. Then, in 'I liked my Bible because it had a lilac cover', I take biblical words out of their original context and turn them into something pleasurable - 'new words to embroider the tongue with' - and finish with a string of them which suggest that a certain approach to life can contribute to social and personal fulfilment. And above all the loveliness of 'otherness'. But I don't want to analyse it to death!
I guess that leads nicely on to your pleasure in playing with the sounds of words.
Even before I could read, my mother used to read poetry to me. One of my favourite poems was John Masefield's 'Cargoes'. It begins, 'Quinquereme of Nineveh from distant Ophir...'. I hadn't the faintest idea what it was about but it was full of the most beautiful-sounding, mysterious words. Then, of course, I studied Anglo-Saxon poetry at university, and I think that also raised my awareness of word-sound. I taught poetry for years, too, and, like many young people with literary ambitions, I started by writing poetry - which focuses the mind like nothing else on the sound qualities of words.
You have to enjoy what you're writing, and, for me, one of the pleasures is 'playing' - if that's the right expression - with words. Thematically, 'playfulness' is important to the collection as it's one of the things - along with colour - that I try to set against the darkness which can so easily overwhelm us. 'The colour of '33' starts by turning the name of the painter Kandinsky into 'sky-candy man', for example. As I said before, the narrator escapes from his one colourless work, and all it stands for, into a 'healing' colour - a sweetness plucked from the sky! And then there's the fun of the gargoyle names in 'Speak, gargoyle'.
As you mentioned, the stories are very varied in form and voice.
I think variety and surprise are important in keeping the reader's interest - and are also a source of pleasure in themselves. As well as conventional first and third person narratives, I also use second person in a couple of stories, which is less usual. It kind of 'implicates' the reader in the story: it's a very direct address. Italo Calvino makes use of it in his novel If on a winter's night a traveller, which I use as a reference point for the story 'Mr Davidsbundler comes to call' (hence the story's subtitle). And the odd name of the 'visitor' I've pinched from the composer Robert Schumann's imaginary 'Band of David' - people who would slay the cultural Philistines. But one doesn't have to know that to enjoy the story - I hope!
Other forms I use include a letter ('Say ""Hello"" to the fairies, Karl'), a monologue (spoken by a gargoyle), a parody detective story, an obituary, a couple of dialogues, one side of an implied dialogue, and I end with something that could be described as a weird kind of little secular sermon. Sometimes I am asking the reader to make a big adjustment from one story to the next. But I hope that's part of the fun!
In many of the stories it feels as if the actual endings are not that important in terms of what the story is really 'about'. Is that a fair comment?
Oh, yes. But then I think that's often the case with short stories as well as novels - apart from some detective fiction where the whole point seems to be to find out, at the end 'who done it' - though I undermine this in my spoof detective story. Yes, I think it's very much what happens in the course of the stories that really counts ... though there are a few exceptions - including two where the whole point comes in the last few words (but I'm not going to tell you which ones!) and which may just catch the reader out ...
It's always interesting to know how much a writer has taken directly from their own life. You've already mentioned your grandfather's paints, but are there any other significant incidents or characters you've lifted straight from life?
Oh, definitely - though sometimes the unexpected things, like the oldish woman in 'The meaning of geranium' - she's a 'local character' and I've described her exactly as she is. The incident at the centre of 'A grandmother's green should be reseda' is an adapted version of something that happened in my childhood (I still have some of the postcards referred to). Despite the 'fantasy' element of 'Pictures for an exhibition', the kernel comes from the fact that my grandfather - who, while still a teenager, fought in the First World War - would only ever copy other people's paintings. 'Looking for Little Miss Universe' was triggered by an old photo I found of my grandmother soon after she died, in her nineties: she was just a little girl in a fancy-dress costume of stars and moons. 'One magenta sock' stems from the fascination my children had for the lurex socks worn by a visiting friend - a poet. 'The colour of '33' came from a visit to an actual Kandinsky exhibition - though the two young Americans are invented - I think! Sometimes, when you've been involved with writing an incident for longer than you took to experience it, the edges begin to blur between what actually happened and one's own shaping of it into a story. That's happened to me more than once! Then there are little details, like the Bible with the lilac cover - which I still have. There are some images from 'In the bruise-coloured night' that originate from the opening exhibition at Tate Modern. The conversations in 'The shock of pink grapefruit' I did actually experience and 'The lavender bride' is my beautiful daughter-in-law. The starting point for 'Campaign for more topaz' was a local demonstration against a proposed new road that would have cut through the best part of the nearby town - including the convent school where I'd been a pupil and where I was teaching at the time. Even the nuns were out there demonstrating, yelling for all they were worth. And so was I. Then I caught sight of my neighbour, a devout Catholic - on the pavement, just watching. I called to her to come and join in but she 'didn't like to' ... as if it were something against her religion! Anyway, that was the feeling behind 'Topaz' - though for some reason I hear it in a slightly African-American voice. And when I was eleven or twelve I had a school friend with whom I used to discuss whether or not animals had souls - used in 'After uranium' ... along with the three-legged dog I remember from a Cornish holiday when I was six.
But, then, of course, there is obviously lots of material in the collection that cannot possibly be taken directly from life - though one cannot write about anything that's not 'in your own head' in some form or other, even when it emerges as extreme fantasy - as in 'Pink' or 'Speak, gargoyle'. I must say, I do have a great affection for my gargoyle - and its wish to say everything before it's too late. In essence, you might say he's an aging writer ...
The title. Why did you choose that particular story to be the title of the whole collection?
Actually I did consider one or two others, including 'Speak, gargoyle' - which is a reference to Nabokov's autobiographical Speak, Memory - a book a I love. But in the end I decided that 'Talking it over with Genghis Khan' did several useful jobs at once - which, ideally, you want from a title. I think - hope - it's intriguing because a bit unusual, and it suggests the coming together of two totally opposite 'things' ... a sort of resolving of an impossibility. The idea of 'talking it over' is of civilised, personal dialogue undertaken to sort out some fairly small problem, whereas the association of Genghis Khan is with large-scale, unstoppable violence and cruelty. In the face of such awfulness, literary creation can only be on the scale of 'talking it over'. But I think the title does alert the reader to the fact that the stories, though light-hearted in many ways, do engage with our darker, more destructive side as well as our puzzlement over our own natures as sentient beings in a vast, detached universe. In one sense, the whole collection is 'talking it over' with ... yes, Genghis Khan!
Even though a number of the stories deal with very dark subjects, you've also spoken a lot about fun and pleasure.
If there is no delight in either the writing or the reading of stories, why bother with them? But at the same time, I don't think you can be a worthwhile or useful writer unless you tackle the darkest or most troubling sides of human life - even if you're doing it in quite miniature works. You don't have to write a War and Peace in order to make people think. And you can wrest some joy and beauty from the terror and strangeness of existence on a small scale and maybe bring about some little transformations in the process ... perhaps.",[],0.0,232.0,1.0,0.0,0.27042207592497114,0.2661654172939521,0.2680129034154058,0.2954143550348991,1.0,0.2889848744840604,1.0,1.0,0.2627308923266122,0.2633122125992888,0.26709769351791013,1.0,0.24220996509423856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Me, too.
Aunt Lee's Library -- the free e-book -- is a good start to solving that dilemma. Here is curated content for you: tantalizing reviews of 77 public domain e-books, including science fiction, humor, satire, romance, pulp, gothic, nonfiction, and classics. I selected them by obsessively cross-checking ""greatest books ever"" lists with lists of books in the public domain. Then I sought out book reviews from online reviewers, including many here on Goodreads, obtained re-print permission, and Aunt Lee's Library is the result.
Search for Aunt Lee's Library on iTunes or Nook, () or read it here on the Goodreads Reader (the green Read Book bar at the left) and start reading the reviews. When you've chosen an e-book, click on the search link at the end of each review, which takes you to a meta-search engine that searches only the best of the free e-book sites -- so much easier, believe me. Just start typing in the book title -- auto-suggest has been pre-coded to do the work for you. Different free e-book sites have different benefits; using this search engine helps you to quickly find the e-book that works best for you.

His quest leads him from the small town of Gemini, Kansas to a small, disadvantaged country in Africa.
Thousands of miles from Kansas, in the rural village of Ataku, half-caste chief, Letivi, grapples with his village's problems. The villagers' main source of income, subsistence cocoa farming, cannot compete with global competition. Young people are leaving the village, and the village's only store is under the control of a foreigner.
Letivi also has personal problems. Wifeless and childless, his ability to understand the family struggles in his village is being questioned. His supernaturally sensitive mother is dying, a tragedy coinciding with the death of the enormous baobab tree into which Letivi's father disappeared years ago.
As Letivi and the villagers plan the development of a cocoa processing plant, Fletcher traces JB to Ataku, prompting a spontaneous trip to Africa with Molly, a ravishing but erratic woman with family ties to the elusive JB.

The eldest sister, Belinda, experiences sudden strange attacks of epilepsy; Sarah, the youngest, develops a craving for sexual perversion; and Nan, normally a contented, rational person, is infected with a morbid obsession with death.
The only clue to these evil transformations lies in an ancient text which defines death as an extension of life - where the evil forces of a character are indestructible and return to infect the living.
Someone must save the sisters from the power of the dead - and save them before their own personalities are irrevocably destroyed.",[],0.0,126.0,1.0,0.0,0.11573133726549215,0.11108387450161826,0.09669651254903742,0.07150647452755968,1.0,0.11252811149395167,1.0,0.0803210813520694,1.0,0.07008183421442656,1.0,0.10175712317561171,0.06319478992768916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

493282,13216107,"America, Wake Up!We are Destroying the American Economy and Ourselves",eng,"In ""Wake Up, America! We are Destroying the American Economy and Ourselves"", Bright Harry debunks the myth of the National Budget Deficit and National Debt and calls them a monumental global fraud. In fact, he asserts that there is nothing like National Budget Deficit and National Debt, that have destroyed the economies of many Nations for hundreds of years and are presently decimating the Economy of every single Nation on earth, including that of the United States.
He asks very profound and poignant questions. What exactly is a Budget? What is a Government Budget Deficit? Who invented the Government Budget Deficit and why? Is Government Budget Deficit the Nation's Budget Deficit? Is the Government the Nation? If the Government is not the Nation, why is the Government Budget Deficit the Nation's Budget Deficit? And why is Government Budget Deficit used as the gauge for the economic health of a Nation?
In answering these poignant questions and more with mathematical precision, logical lucidity and history, he proves beyond even a scintilla of doubt that we are dealing with mere illusions, albeit very deadly ones.
Simply and succinctly, he explains the difference between the Real Nations Deficit and the Phony Government Budget Deficit.
He concludes by challenging us, that ""We the People"" of the United States must wake up from our ignorance of this Budget Deficit Economic Fraud being perpetrated against us by the Budget Deficit Hawks, and assert our sovereign power to take control of our Economy, our Lives and our Country, NOW.",[],0.0,122.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.04054692533178889,0.035335259984437935,1.0,1.0,0.031451245413700646,0.034986995050968306,1.0,0.03322595308925198,0.028653429747923204,0.034566805903368344,0.03435687702310368,0.032449246647204485,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
497707,26020535,Poems from Captain Salty's: Crumbles of Piecemeal Pie,eng,"Poems from Captain Salty's uses metaphors, rhyme schemes, and word-play to mask a deeper meaning. A few are overt, and comment on issues the world needs to or has made great strides to amend. Allegories, parodies, and miscalculated tapestries imbue Salty's pages with realism. Its poems are rarely fantastical and tend to comment on legends or crumbles from the mythical properties of history.
My narrative poetry comes to light in this book. I frequently depart from the metrical and lyrical sound boards that were cells to me so long. It is truly a departure for me. There are both obvious and subtle double entendres. The poems are bold and stir the pots of diversity; they call kettles black and skim lines of perversity--just enough to simmer. They stew issues as varied as racism and women's strides toward equality. Salty's poems ponder isolation and disparity, how society has come together and how it has just as easily grown apart. His poems often confess how individuals meet briefly to compare notes from the heart.
Life slowed things down for me in 2012. I like to say I retired from America. I quite gratefully left the game much of America plays where the dollar waits patiently at the end of every bank of cubicles, where CEOs get fat watching cogs oil their chairs so they swivel. I retired from one of the many incarnations of ""the American dream."" I decided to follow my dream, the one that begins to realize itself when that dollar is replaced with a FOR RENT sign at the end of cubicles. At mid-way in life, money is not everything. In fact, it was never really anything to me except a means to a tenuous life of the odd extravagance. Peace of mind, enjoying life, and living far, far off anyone's time continuum can last at least thirty years. Now, in 2015, that pendulous life I fed for years is remembered more as a nightmare. I savor life, I favor it and see it for what it is-- or was.
Captain Salty is a metaphor. He's a sailor, a fisherman, a-- salt of the earth. He is a repentant pirate, a retired buccaneer watching sea squalls and albatrosses beneath a beard. To him, life's a puzzle, and his has been lived piece-meal. He's seen America at its best, its worst, and the odd peace between the two states.",[],0.0,86.0,1.0,0.0,0.17354253441778256,0.17582471458066645,0.1638084504443543,1.0,1.0,0.17364453596431156,1.0,0.169615327629983,0.14973579179805724,0.15131514310072544,0.15209107303134212,1.0,0.1251948020454984,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

506961,2508414,Hi-Doh Hi-Dee Ha-Ha,eng,"In 1995, I completed my fantasy novel, Hi-doh Hi-dee Ha-Ha. I sent it out to a few, established New York publishers, and one, Putnam, did show interest but eventually passed on it. I had read a few books on self-publishing and when a local publisher who I worked for as a feature writer offered to publish it, I thought, why not. I can do the marketing and get it out to the distributors and bookstores. Or so I thought. I never realized how difficult it is, how people will judge a book not on its merits but on your publisher. They never heard of mine, so how could my book be worth selling or reading.
Being a local journalist, I was able to get reviewed by local reviewers and all were positive, some even admirable, but I had no luck with any of the respected journals, the ones for instance on which libraries base their purchases. Again, who had ever heard of my publisher - he published local magazines and promotional tabloids; he had never published a book. I did go to a few schools, and the kids at one school in particular loved it. I was invited there twice, once to the class that read it, and another time for a school assembly during which I and a colleague from Toastmasters did a performance. The principal told me that her office was next door to the class that read it and said she knew when their teacher was reading from it, because they were usually in an uproar.
Yes, they liked Hi-doh Hi-dee Ha-Ha, for the same reason that I think it's my best book, though I have had seven books published since then by established publishers. It's whimsical, poetic, silly, and profound only in a way that the child in all of us can understand. But it is still almost unknown nearly 20 years later. Harry Potter became the rage and Hi-doh Hi-dee Ha-Ha is still waiting for its readers.
So many people have said no to me about selling or carrying the book at a library, for instance, but none of them have actually read it. Oh, maybe a few pages, like the children's book expert who was put off by the use of the word ""fart"" on the first page. In this day and age, the first word some children say is ""fart."" Well, maybe not the first, but among the first words. In any case, it was used to evoke humor not bad taste.
Now, nearly 20 years later, I am hoping that people will give this book a chance as one of the first reviewers said in 1997, because ""it has the personality to attract a wide spectrum of admirers."" Or, as Yolanda, the yoyo bird, said in the book, ""in the yanguage of yappiness, there is yoh such yord as yoh, there is only yes."" Say, yes, to Hi-doh Hi-dee Ha-Ha, and I promise you won't be disappointed.

The purpose of this publication is to present sound principles for wood-frame house construction and suggestions for selecting suitable materials in a manner that will greatly assist in the construction of a good house even by those without previous construction experience. The three primary essentials for the building of a satisfactory house are (1) an efficient plan, (2) suitable materials, and (3) sound construction. The house may be large or small, elaborate or unpretentious, modern or traditional, yet without all three of these essentials it may be neither permanent nor satisfactory. While designing and planning are beyond the scope of this publication, the information on materials and building practices is intended to guide builders and prospective homeowners in erecting a good house. It can be used as a training aid for apprentices or as a standard by which to judge the quality of the construction of a house. This publication is devoted exclusively to wood-frame construc-
tion, and sets forth what are considered to be acceptable practices in assembling and arranging the parts of a well-designed house. While
details of construction may vary in different localities, the fundamental principles are the same. This publication deals essentially
with established methods of construction, and it does not attempt to show new types that are constantly appearing in various parts of the country. Construction details for houses are given in a series of drawings. These drawings, with accompanying text, show the methods used in
assembling the various parts. Additional information on painting, fire protection, and decay prevention is given near the end of this

This book is presented as a homage to the Sydney Aboriginal people's knowledge,culture, and land in 1788-1791 - and still very much alive today. It is also presented in tribute to William Dawes' skills and humanity.
Introduction
About this book
The notebooks of William Dawes, written from 1790 to 1791, contain his detailed and thoughtful description of the Indigenous language spoken in Sydney. This language was the first of Australia's 250 Indigenous languages to be learnt by English colonisers,and the notebooks are one of Australia's oldest written sources documenting Aboriginal people, life and culture.
This book is one of the results of a project conducted at the Endangered Languages Archive at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London (SOAS). The project's aims were to digitise the Dawes notebooks and make them available both on the World Wide Web and in printed form.
The Dawes notebooks are held in SOAS Library's Special Collections. Their content is of great significance to the Sydney Aboriginal communities, other NSW and Australian
Aboriginal communities, and to linguists and historians. Recent popular publications and broadcasts have also attracted general public interest in the people who animate
the notebooks, in particular William Dawes - their principal author, and his friend Patyegarang - Dawes' main language teacher.
The Aboriginal languages spoken in the area of the Sydney Basin were destroyed so rapidly and comprehensively under colonisation that Dawes' work remains the single most important source of written information about them. Little further information was collected, such that the best resources on the languages today (as well as the growing language revitalisation activities in the Aboriginal communities of the area)remain based on Dawes' writings. However, until now, Dawes' notebooks were only accessible in Australia through the interpretations of other writers or by viewing microfilm versions held at the Mitchell Library and the National Library of Australia.
The notebooks contain many words in the language of Sydney, which is today commonly known as Dharuk. They also contain many human stories, as Jones (2008:46) describes:
""Dawes recorded his informal, even intimate, conversations with a number of Aboriginal people, not only with the young woman Patyegarang, but also with Aboriginal men such as Bennelong""
This book began its life as a website and is intended to be used in conjunction with the site:
http://www.williamdawes.org
The site contains more transcriptions in greater detail, colour images of the pages,and further information about the Dharuk language and about Dawes' life before,during and after his time in Sydney.
How to use this book
The purpose of this book is to reproduce the Dawes notebooks and to make their content more accessible through a new set of detailed transcriptions created especially for this project.
As shown in the diagram 'Organisation of the pages', the top section of each page contains the images of the notebook pages. This book reflects the true form of the

Dreams
Baranay has risen above her feminine voice and foreigner perspective to strike a neutral unbiased language as far as basic values and issues are concerned.
She uncannily conjures splashes of Indian reactions, attitudes or
relationships with as much authenticity as she does the American,
Australian and British ethos. What makes the novel endearing is the high voltage resonance of the poignant tales of the protagonists woven around the theme of globalisation, leaving a sea wave effect on the readers long after they have finished the read.

572115,7851055,The New Culture of Learning and Growth in the Baha'i Community: A Paradigm Change,eng,"I posted an introduction to the paradigmatic shift in the Baha'i community, the new culture of learning and growth that is at the heart of this paradigm, nearly four years ago. I did this posting at several internet sites and have revised that post many times in these last four years as developments in the paradigm have come about, as new messages from Baha'i institutions have been published and as many individuals have commented verbally and in print on this new Baha'i culture. Here are some specific steps on how to access this article, what is now a book of more than 170,000 words and nearly 400 pages. It is found at Baha'i Library Online(BLO). With the publication on 21/4/'10 of an 8,000 word message from the Universal House of Justice and the 10,000 word message to the Continental Boards of Counsellors on 28/12/'10--two of the longest messages of the Formative Age since a charismatic Force in the Person of Baha'u'llah was institutionalized in the Person of Abdul-Baha and then in the Guardianship and, in 1963, effloresced in that apex of Baha'i administration--the Universal House of Justice.
In the time this book has been on the internet there have been many thousand views of this analysis, this statement on the new paradigm at the few sites where it has been posted. In addition to googling ""Baha'i Culture of Learning and Growth"" and accessing this article in the process at several internet sites, readers can find this piece of writing at BLO by clicking on the following:
bahai-library.org/file.php?file=price_cultu...
Readers can also access the latest edition of this article at BLO by taking the following steps: (i) type Baha'i Library Online or Baha'i Academics Resource Library into your search engine; (ii) click on the small box ""By author"" at the top of the access page at BLO; (iii) type ""Price"" into the small box that appears and then click on the word ""Go;"" and then (iv) scroll down to article/document item #44, and (v) finally click on that item enabling you to read to your heart's content. When your eyes and your mind start to glaze over, stop reading. The article can be downloaded free; you will have access to this book, this context for all this new paradigmatic terminology that has come into the Baha'i community in the last 15 years with an integration of the most recent and relevant passages from House of Justice messages.
My statement, my book, is a personal one, does not assume an adversarial attitude, attempts to give birth of as fine an etiquette of expression as I can muster and, I like to think, possesses both candour and critical thought on the one hand and praise and delight at the many interrelated processes involved in the execution of this paradigm on the other. I invite readers to what I also like to think is ""a context on which relevant fundamental questions"" regarding this new paradigm may be discussed within the Baha'i community. This book places in context what I want to illustrate, namely, my take on this new Baha'i paradigm after a decade and a half of its implementation. My book possesses no authority. Indeed, such a remark hardly needs saying.
One of the advantages of the BLO site is the freedom it gives to a writer to update his or her article or book right on the site in an ongoing process as new insights from major thinkers in the Baha'i community and information from the elected and appointed institutions of the Cause comes to hand. If time and the inclination permit, check it out. No worries, no obligation, just if it interests you. You may find the piece of writing too long as I'm sure many readers do. It is certainly a view from the inside, but it is just one person's view building as it does on the ideas and writings of others: Baha'i institutions and individuals. We each have a different experience on the inside of this paradigm, on the inside of this Faith or, indeed, living on the inside of our global society. You may find this book too personal due to the fact that I attempt to answer the questions: ""where do I fit into this new paradigm?"" ""what have I done?"" and ""where am I going in my service to the wider community and in the exercise of my spiritual obligation to teach the Cause. After a few paragraphs of reading, you will get the flavour of the exercise. Just keep reading if your mind and spirit are enjoying the process.

577025,23502494,Zhuang Zi and the Fully Realized Human,eng,"In the early morning of philosophy, Chinese philosophy and Greek philosophy chose divergent paths. The Chinese tended to regard everything in the Universe as a unity. The Greeks, and those who followed them, tended to regard things as being made up of discrete components. The Greek ideas led to the modern idea of a Universe composed of a huge, and possibly infinite, number of elementary particles. The Chinese ideas led in another direction that the West first approached via the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, was purified of some of its hangovers from medieval philosophy by Edmund Husserl, and eventually appears in context of physics as quantum mechanics.
It is very difficult for humans to comprehend the idea of a Universe that contains no discrete entities, a Universe that is a continuum, not a Universe that could be taken apart as one would disassemble a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle.
Zhuang Zi understood that experience comes to humans as a continuum. In nature there are no black lines drawn around birds, trees, or anything else. Humans, metaphorically speaking, draw lines around so-called ""things,"" give them names, make up more-or-less plausible narratives about them, and assign values to them. Sometimes humans get it really wrong and have to learn how to remove value tags and even erase lines, and then look at really there and try to make a more appropriate ""figure and ground"" separation.
One example of the need to tear down old conceptualizations is the history of our understanding of light. At first, Newton thought of it as ""corpuscles,"" next, it was discovered that light can produce interference patterns, so light was declared to be a wave phenomenon. With the advent of quantum mechanics it was learned that light, paradoxically, has characteristics of both wave and particle, and what you observe will depend on how you look at it.
This book uses examples from martial arts to illuminate what Zhuang Zi says because fighting demands rapid evaluations used to maintain total situational awareness, a circumstance that penalizes people severely for mis-perception or mis-conceptualization. As one Japanese martial arts teachers explained, karate is moving Zen. Zen is deeply indebted to the worldview developed by Zhuang Zi and Lao Zi.
This book uses martial arts as one way toward understanding what Zhuang Zi is talking about.",[],0.0,517.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.08409892990075084,1.0,0.09774908405653372,0.09101044565331509,1.0,0.09237155583751862,0.1003655613677127,0.07949413186514209,0.08313547955879252,0.08682816841601851,0.07555703989462534,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

901,16137127,Certainty and the Search for Absolute Truth,eng,"Wait! Before you fly into that building...
What is truth? Is it knowable?
Can we be absolutely certain about anything?
A momentous work of philosophy doesn't have to be massive and unreadable. No example of philosophy that you'll encounter will deal with Certainty and Truth more concisely and compellingly than this book, yet it does so while maintaining an engaging style that keeps the cerebral content very readable and accessible. Like previous philosophies that address Certainty and Truth, the work HAD to address the issue of God, yet unlike it's predecessors, manages to do so without any hidden assumptions. As a result, it holds confirmations of orthodox Christianity that are unprecedented.
The book adopts a partially autobiographical style as it details how the hyper-rational author went from the purest form of agnosticism to fundamentalist Christianity over a span of years. Within are essays that address common misconceptions that skeptics and Christians share. There is also a miraculous quality to the account that speaks to the heart.
The fact that the author is a recent stroke victim, cognitively impaired and partially paralyzed, makes it more apparent that he cannot take credit for any cleverness reflected in this book. There are things on a par with Einstein's ""On The Photoelectric Effect"" or ""On Brownian Motion"" Since the author admits to having the barest of math abilities, it's fortunate that the issues in this work do not require the same mathematical rigor to express as Einstein's remarkable understandings. Nevertheless, the assertion of novelty and momentousness for this work is appropriate. There are intellectually satisfying answers to questions that people have grappled with for centuries. Questions like:
To what extent is anything knowable?
How can Jesus be the Son of God and God Himself?
How can a loving God send anyone to Hell?

16188,18512518,The Legal Status of Transsexual and Transgender Persons,eng,"The need to allow a change of legal sex/gender in certain cases is no longer disputed in most jurisdictions, and for European countries there is no question as to whether such a change should be allowed after the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Goodwin v. United Kingdom (Application no. 28957/95). The question has therefore shifted to what the requirements for such a change of the legal sex/gender should be. Many jurisdictions have legislated or developed an administrative approach to changing sex/gender, but the requirements differ significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, particularly with regard to age, nationality and marital status, as well as the medical and psychological requirements. The latter in some jurisdictions still include surgery and sterility as a precondition, thus potentially forcing the persons concerned to choose between the recognition of their sex/gender identity and their physical integrity. This book examines questions that are thus far under-researched, namely what the full legal consequences of a change of legal sex/gender should be, for example with regard to existing legal relationships such as marriages and registered partnerships, but also concerning children and parentage. The Legal Status of Transsexual and Transgender Persons is the result of an international research project, including not only national reports from 14 European and non-European jurisdictions but also two chapters that look at legal sex/gender changes from a Christian perspective and one chapter from a medical-psychological perspective. The final comparative chapter compares and contrasts the different approaches and requirements and makes recommendations for best practice and law reform.",[],1.0,678.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.043234036736704944,0.04650774604090114,1.0,1.0,0.046031774882412904,0.045894668595348465,0.047062440848119294,0.04296683608390812,0.036952158615427104,0.04545025946790848,1.0,0.03332209201632319,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Battling against hypocrisies, sadomasochism and perfunctory pursuits of pop benchmarks of successes, he refuses the passion-oriented male worldview of karma and life's purposes. Metamorphosed by compassion, that love's innocence fills him with, he opts for a journey that takes him far away from the stupidity of self-worth, calculated in terms of personal utility, individualistic possession and unfettered consumption. Does he arrive?
Mayank Mishra, a 34-year old news-editor with a newspaper in an Indian city, takes up the challenges in his personal as well as professional lives; caught between the conflicting agendas of passion and compassion. His passion calls him to battle the hypocrisies, which the popular benchmarks of the societal notions fill up his professional as well as personal universe with. Then, the innocence of love and total intimacy exposes him to compassion, leading him to diametrically opposite life energies, marked by forgiveness. He realizes; he standing beyond the best of the potentials and capabilities of his 'acultured' and uninhibited mind is his own God but he needs an unlearning mechanism to delete the wrong programming of his mind.
In the contemporary worldview, which paints the hypocrisy of art and lies about idealisms; he templates sketches of heroic moments of personal crises to break free from the suffocation of the optionlessness of pop success, with humble reception of the sanity of simplicity and innocence.
How he manages his personal and societal conflicts, rises above his encumbrances and finally picks up a road less traversed for a journey, which makes him feel he has already arrived, sums up the novel.",[],1.0,191.0,1.0,1.0,0.09149500700221942,0.09620419053048417,0.0839937186365567,1.0,1.0,0.09904326932427815,1.0,0.09185321197927228,0.07283339462023389,0.09444532465471778,0.07673019002300101,1.0,0.06336883320830199,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

She waited for him. Not because she loved him but because she was scared of him and what she was contemplating.
He walked in through the kitchen door wearing his black short sleeved turtleneck and his dark sunglasses. Olive skinned, handsome, slender and buff. Staggering a bit towards her, wanting to give her a kiss.
The smell of his breath was nauseating. Mr. Playboy full of charm and not much more than that. She turned her face away from him. She rejected him and he felt that deep inside. His succorance for affection rejected. Now asking about the baby.

It was obvious she was not from the city. Inexperienced with just the charms of a fallacy ready to snatch her. Giving rise to his gilded specious charismatic charm. She was completely pure and very impressionable.

Herein, Van Til deals with the works of Barth and Brunner and their ""Theology of Crisis,""warning a generation of evangelicals of the danger of neo-orthodoxy as a new form of modernism.

He retired in 1972, but remained as an emeritus professor until his death in 1987. Van Til, an immigrant from The Netherlands, was one of the most respected apologetic theologians of his time.

We live in 'exciting times'. Successions of stunning electoral defeats for the forces of liberalism are symptoms of a citizens' revolt against the elites and their democratic deficit.
These populist rebellions are incoherent, powerful yet literally reactionary, responses to globalism. The millions of citizens who have slapped the elites in the face know what they are against, but have no guiding vision of what they are for.
The resulting lack of direction is very dangerous. The globalists have been shaken to the core, but they are already regrouping and planning their counter-attacks. This renewed danger can only be met if the forces of tradition and identity develop a coherent, positive vision for a better future.
Populist revolts are not enough. For secure, lasting victory they have to be transformed into full-scale National Revolutions. But there can be no revolution in action without first a revolution in ideas and in the hearts of future revolutionaries.

If you believe that Goodreads 'Review' system is fair, you need to read about troll review attacks that are also documented widely on the Internet. And let me warn you about a number of broken features on the website that may affect your sales. The main thing you must understand, though, is that you are on the bottom of the food chain at Goodreads. You are the income that keeps the server farm humming but you are entering into an adversarial relationship, not only with the pampered readers but the overworked staff that doesn't even know their own rules when they punish you because there are so damned many rules and the documentation is broken, outdated chaos.
The booklet is short and free. It provides a lot of links to information on the Internet that you should know and links to the documentation at Goodreads.

418976,9790890,Thread: And Selected New York Poems,eng,"Many critical voices, in several languages, have praised the poet Vasyl Makhno. But in the case of this book such praise is only half of the golden apple. Without an excellent or, more precisely, a fully adequate translator, the poet's name would be meaningless to most people, and a book of bad translations would distort his name. Makhno is very lucky to have found an adequate English-language translator. Orest Popovych, although (or, perhaps, because) he is a scientist by profession, is able to capture not only the text but also the subtext of this poetry. Never attempting, as some poet-translators do, to outsing the original song, Popovych attentively listens not only to he words but also to the melody and spirit of these poems long before putting pen to paper. As a result, those who do not have the Ukrainian language, may rest assured that they get the kernel of these powerful texts, and those who do will delight in the translator's art.

When she finally discovers his infidelity, she throws him out and Martin lands at a B&B run by Emma, an officer in the local prison. While his new landlady is pleasant enough, Martin quickly learns that her husband left her for a barmaid, and she's become particularly hostile to men. When she assigns her new boarder a number of domestic chores, he willingly agrees. And so begins Emma's deliberate scheme to make Martin her slavish houseboy. With a strong fixation for the female sex, Martin easily relents to the woman's demands, and he's soon turned into her groveling slave. Though she can be a hard and demanding mistress, a strong, even affectionate, bond develops between the two. Martin is soon a fixture in Emma's female world, where he's humiliated, punished and trained to sexually service his mistress and her many female friends. The Prison Governor, Vanessa, uses him as a party toy, then later a sadistic male guard will force him to suck cock and take it in the ass.

453739,19066276,"Ballots, Bullets & Kabulshit: An Afghan Election",en-US,"Ahead of the 2009 presidential elections in Afghanistan, Australian electoral advisor and Gruen Planet panellist Toby Ralph joined a UN team to assist local authorities unused to free and fair democratic processes - and in some cases, not keen on adopting them. Amid the 'War on Terror', resistance ranged from corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude to lethal violence.
Ralph's diarised account is a rare glimpse into the day-to-day experiences of those charged with delivering the freedom and democracy Western leaders promise the disenfranchised. With the wry humour of a seasoned politico (or someone trying to distract themselves from the very real dangers of their situation), he provides snapshots of life in Kabul, a primer in the political shambles of a failing state, and the reflections of a non-combatant working in a war zone in a suit and tie. He is whisked between meetings in armoured cars, tries to avoid sitting on the AK-47 down the back of the couch at his lodgings, dines with colleagues in sandbagged candlelit restaurants, and attempts to convince the Electoral Commission chairman - and friend of President Hamid Karzai - that having an election is a good idea.

There he is. Gods, I love it when he cooks. I wandered in here the second day that I was living in this wretched city. A block away from my apartment, the smells emanating from this Mongolian grill drew me in like a fly to honey. The food was decent, and I thought I might come here every once in a while when I didn't feel like cooking. Then I saw him. Hat on backwards, tattoos decorating his delectable skin, and the smile he gave me when I stepped up to the grill with my bowl of ingredients. *swoon*
It's been a month now, and I eat here every day. Either for lunch or for dinner, it doesn't matter to me. I think one of the waiters has realized why I come in. Whenever Darren isn't on shift, he gives a knowing smile and says, ""I'll get you a menu, Stefan.""

Sebastian had never thought about being submissive to anyone before the sexy Gavin Sanborn had proposed the idea to him one day in his Bistro. Now that the idea and opportunity was there, he was intrigued enough to learn more. Sebastian definitely wanted Gavin. The only problem was Sebastian also wanted the one woman he'd denied for most of their lives, his best friend and house mate, Carissa.
Gavin had wanted the owner and chef of his favorite Bistro for some time now, but he'd also had his attention on the chef's lady friend. The fiery red head had captured him from the first time he set eyes on her. Gavin had been looking for the person he could love and spend the rest of his life with; he just wondered if one or both of them could be the solution and become the love he'd been looking for.
This story continues from Shared Desires Book 1: Gavin's Search.
Excerpt
Sebastian Hartwell sat at a table in the back of the dining room of his Italian Bistro doing paperwork and setting up next month's schedule. It was almost closing time. He wasn't in the mood to deal with anymore problems tonight. He'd already been here preparing dishes since opening this morning. His other chef had called off with only a few moments notice so there was no one he could call.
Someone stepped up to his table. If this was another problem, he just might blow his top.
Sebastian didn't even look at the person. ""Can I help you?"" he asked, thinking it was one of his employees.
""I certainly hope so.""
Sebastian laid down his pen at the rich, seductive voice. He had to see what the man looked like who spoke in such tones. The man had to be at least six foot two or three and somewhere between one ninety to two hundred pounds, there wasn't an ounce of fat anywhere on his well-proportioned body.
The man's black slacks looked like they were molded to his body. His white dress shirt was tucked into the waist of his pants and was hanging half-unbuttoned, and the sleeves were rolled up to just below his elbows.
From what Sebastian could see, the man's skin was dark bronze and flawless, his long coal black hair was pulled back in a ponytail. His face was chiseled and so handsome it was almost breathtaking. His brown eyes, so deep and secretive, his full pink lips looked soft and very kissable. The man looked and smelled like temptation itself. He had seen the man in here before, many times, but never this close.
""Was there a problem with your meal or your service this evening?"" Sebastian questioned.
""No,"" the man shook his head. ""Everything was to my satisfaction. It always is when I eat here.""
""Was there something else I could do for you?"" Sebastian certainly hoped there was something he could do for this sexy stranger.
""Have you ever been with a Dom?"" the man asked point blank, and Sebastian wondered how the stranger even knew he was gay.
""No,"" Sebastian stated with a slight chuckle. ""Do I strike you as a man who wants to be told what to do and when to do it?""
""I'm not sure what sort of man you strike me as being. Maybe it was just wishful thinking on my part. Still I have to ask. Would you ever consider giving it a try?""
""Are you seriously asking me to be your submissive?"" Sebastian asked, his voice sounding almost comical and a little uncertain, nothing like he wanted it to sound.
""If I am?"" the man questioned arching one black brow.
""What makes you think I'm into men? I happen to be living with a very beautiful woman.""
""There's absolutely nothing wrong with liking or wanting both. Are you in love with this beautiful woman that you're living with?""
""I love her,"" Sebastian said with a nod of his head.
""Would you consider meeting with me and perhaps having a talk over drinks or dinner to get to know one another?"" the stranger asked.
""Why don't you leave me your number and I'll think about it and get back to you.""
Sebastian watched as the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a business card and pen. He scribbled something on the back of it and then held it out to him. ""My name is Gavin and that's my personal cell number on the back of that card, call me anytime.""
""I'm Sebastian,"" he said as he reached out to take the card. His fingers brushed the other man's slightly. A spark of electricity went up his arm and through his body. Sebastian's cock immediately surged to attention, pulsating against the zipper of his white chef's pants.
""Don't make me wait too long, Sebastian."" Gavin's demand was soft.",[],1.0,57.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.17385688840657548,1.0,0.15156958382166574,1.0,0.15518471545511311,0.19234718658847216,0.1503337319577393,0.1860546039359372,0.14945207925743123,0.19152828802196395,1.0,0.11544039098986589,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

228122,3440633,Issue Voting: An Introduction,eng,"In our poll-driven age, political attitude surveys have become something of an academic industry. Researchers have proposed numerous models to explain the relationship between a particular issue and voter behavior, but there is no consensus on which approaches work best. Issue Voting offers a welcome overview of the various models in use today, their strengths and their shortcomings. In the early days of democracy, issues played a leading role in shaping American and Western European party systems. Liberal parties were formed explicitly to combat privilege, conservative parties to defend the military or the monarchy, socialist parties to champion unions, agrarian parties to campaign for the redistribution of land. By the time the first election studies came out in the 1940s, however, issue voting was of minor importance. Instead, the vote of the ordinary citizen reflected group norms - class, ethnic, religious and geographical norms - and the main factor in voting behavior was party identification, followed by candidate identification. In the early 1970s, evidence emerged of a surge in issue voting, and since then, political writers have proposed many models to describe its mechanisms. Yet their suggestions tend to be found in either professional articles that focus on some isolated aspect of issue voting, or single-election studies, a chapter of which sets forth some ad hoc model for the occasion. This volume provides a sorely needed overview of the approaches available. Ole Borre shows how the different models highlight consistency, position and issue distance, salience, valence issues and performance. He keeps the statistics simple, illustrating the various approaches with recent British and Danish election data and favoring linear regression whenever possible. Issue Voting will be invaluable to political scientists and modern historians trying to make sense of this quintessential democratic phenomenon.",[],1.0,160.0,1.0,2.0,0.047733809944213196,0.04208998171744261,0.04139443675996238,1.0,1.0,0.039140916424267196,0.040427002765736166,1.0,0.0447633367233216,0.04826149386729629,0.04275738281043534,1.0,0.04508946663376848,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Did they really exist? For centuries, scholars consigned them to the world of myth, but Lyn Webster Wilde journeyed into the homeland of the Amazons and uncovered astonishing evidence of their historic reality.
North of the Black Sea she found archaeological excavations of graves of Iron Age women buried with arrows, swords and armour. In the hidden world of the Hittites, near the Amazons' ancient capital of Thermiscyra in Anatolia, she unearthed traces of powerful priestesses, women-only religious cults, and an armed, bisexual goddess - all possible sources for the ferocious women.
Combining scholarly penetration with a sense of adventure, Webster Wilde has produced a coherent and absorbing book that challenges preconceived notions, still disturbingly widespread, of what men and women can do.",[],6.0,218.0,1.0,2.33,0.09546730429219762,1.0,0.07756182911798645,0.09007020627623073,1.0,0.0693455584364171,1.0,0.10263506762703326,0.09542345267035265,0.055768827869635475,0.1030402703161858,1.0,0.07597697687092064,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

A murder takes place in the dean's office of a law school, and the perpetrator, wearing a Donald Duck mask, flees after throwing his pistol to Dean Ansari. When the dean's secretary walks into the office, she sees Ansari standing over the body, gun in hand, and accuses him of murder. Giving a flimsy excuse, the dean vanishes. After a fruitless search for him, his secretary returns to discover that the body is gone. Only blood on the carpet remains. In a matter of minutes, three people have disappeared.
Thinking he might be wrongly convicted of a heinous crime, Dean Ansari escapes, panic-stricken, to India - the farthest place in his imagination. However, he leaves careless clues, and Detective Joe Walsh is able to trace him to Mumbai. He and the dean meet there and, not recognising each other, become friends.
During this time, Ansari falls in love with a Chinese courtesan who steals his money on orders from her pimp, Raji Rau. When the penniless dean realises he must leave again, he turns to her for help. They flee together, Ansari clueless that her generous offer to pay for their expenses is actually with his own money. Their escape is hardly the end of the dean's troubles. Other mishaps occur, and perplexing questions remain: Who was the person in the Donald Duck mask? Was there a murder? If so, what happened to the body? Does Joe Walsh ever catch up with Dean Ansari?

Aris tucked the barrel of his 9mm Beretta into the small of his back. ""SEER sha."" he repeated, having never heard the name before. The sound of it rolled off his tongue with the silky ease of a French kiss.
""It's Gaelic."" she said, as if the fire in her demeanor hadn't already told him that. ""Maybe your boy over there should move faster getting that trash can over here before she throws up on your shoe tops.""
This woman was no ordinary hostage, but then again, this wasn't a run of the mill bank robbery.
Armed with the idea that they were sent to end evil in the world, Aris and his team know that when you steal money from a bank, the government prints more. After all, it's only paper, until something goes horribly wrong.
Lives change forever on a warm sunny summer afternoon. A man dies, another is injured, a traitor is left behind, and one man's heart is taken.
It's only after things return to normal that Aris becomes aware that his thoughts are not where they should be. His body yearns for something he's only barely tasted. His heart is heavy with the burden of what he cannot have. Exhausting himself by day is the only way the still of the night doesn't become sheer torment. Lesser men would break and surrender, but Aris is not a weak man.
The impossible has to happen and Aris is determined it will. From squalor to poverty to a budget the size of a small nation, famine to fed, illiterate to educated, chaotic masses to well run organization, the pieces fall into place one by one over the course of seven years that lead him back to where his heart was lost.
""Ah. Rescuing a damsel in distress always puts a man on a pedestal in a woman's eyes."" he rolled his eyes.
""You tore my skirt, dropped my Choo's in the dirt, duct taped me to a stolen helicopter, and as if that wasn't enough fun for one day, I got to spend the rest of the week with the Feds. Oh, a pedestal by all means. How about a pedestal called the gallows!"" she didn't realize she was squeezing him as she got more wound up.
He would have liked nothing better at the moment than to wrap both of his arms around her, but this was a very upscale establishment where there were norms that had to be observed. Instead, he pulled her closer to him putting his hip back between hers, where they had started on the dance floor. His breath on her neck caused a shiver down her spine causing her hips to tilt into his. The fact that she noticed how well endowed he was made her that much angrier.

Anne might have achieved her object and remained a rebel and an outcast all her life had not Marjorie Lawrence, Grangemount's most popular and sympathetic mistress, noticed the girl's love for animals and realised that there must be some good in her after all.
But Miss Lawrence's efforts on Anne's behalf at first seemed so hopeless and unrewarding that she nearly gave up in despair.

As witnessed during the very close 2014 referendum on Scottish independence and during the 2016 referendum on British EU membership, sub-state national identities in Britain remain strong and increasingly challenge the idea of a United Kingdom. In Britain Today, topics and key subjects are chosen to reflect the most important social, political, and cultural issues in Britain today, with a focus on those that Scandinavian lecturers and students will find particularly important and engaging.
Avoiding overly descriptive approaches, the book provides introductions to prominent ideas, social, political, and cultural critique and responses, all of contemporary relevance. In addition to providing the necessary basic and factual assignments, topics for presentations and essays, and literature for further reading. It thus sets stages that will enable students to critically relate to attitudes and ideas, and inspire their own in-depth exploration.
The chapters of the book are organised thematically and arranged in balanced and substantial modules. This means that each chapter can stand alone and need not be read or taught as part of a particular sequence. This allows lecturers to easily design a course on the basis of Britain Today according to their own preferences or curricular demands.",[],1.0,333.0,1.0,2.0,0.052485700203836756,1.0,0.03994998368930328,1.0,1.0,0.050906532072231114,0.05375685256444851,1.0,0.04200052173733893,0.04557620116942501,0.04074915850556245,0.04930634897277104,0.052338688390817505,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Recent archeological discoveries have thrown a great deal of new light on the Bible. That is what this book is about. The author, John Elder, who lives in Iran, has for many years been surrounded by these archeological evidences, & has drawn freely upon the study & writing that has already been done as to their extent & interpretation. Using this material freely, he has told a story that is both coherent & dramatic & successfully brings together all relevant material as to the method, manner & meaning of the ""diggings"" which so often indicate that Bible references are not as obscure as some have thought, and that The Book is indeed rooted & grounded in history. He begins at the beginning, Genesis, & goes on thru Revelation. Those who have visited the Holy Land will get special delight from this book, for it will bring back to them with deeper meaning the scenes they have visited all too briefly.--Kirkus

On a dark night in a small South African church, Alec Rowlands encountered God in a staggering, powerful, and umistakable way. Though he was only eleven years old at the time, he knew that nothing would ever be the same.
Yet as Alec's journey continued -- he grew up, moved to America, and became a pastor -- he began to wonder why his spiritual life hadn't kept pace with his boyhood experience. Why did he so often feel God's absence more than his presence? Where was the passion he had once felt?
Compelled by his questions, Alec began to study historic revivals and transforming movements of God. What he discovered altered his perspective forever.
In The Presence, Alec shares what he has learned about the God who invites us into an encounter that C. S. Lewis likened to meeting an untamed lion. Whose very presence overwhelms our senses and transforms our lives. Who draws near and changes everything, including the way we think about God.

Soon after the publication, this book stirred controversy over the nature of male sexuality, male ""frigidity,"" and its connection to the ""Lolita complex."" Today, this work is considered a classic in Japanese men's studies.
The most striking feature of this book is that it was written from the author's first-person perspective. The author is a professor who teaches philosophy and ethics at a university in Japan, and in this book he talks about his own sexual fetishism, his feeling of emptiness after ejaculation, and his huge obsession with young girls and their developing female bodies. He undertakes a philosophical investigation of how and why sexuality took such a form within a person who had grown up as a ""normal,"" heterosexual man.
This may be the first case in which a philosopher delves deep into his own sexuality and poses an ambitious hypothesis about the formation of male ""frigid"" sexuality, which might actually be shared by many ""normal"" men in our society in a hidden way. Reading this book, female readers will come to know, for the first time, some hidden aspects of male sexuality which men have skillfully submerged in a deep layer of their psyches.",[],3.0,204.0,1.0,2.33,1.0,0.10539558525148489,0.10452494879783877,0.09762149619620585,1.0,0.08591344230137628,1.0,0.10473238474138448,0.09897200148388302,0.07458920319612473,0.1081557633900437,1.0,0.08504308963997077,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

When Carrie accidentally-on-purpose breaks Michael's arm, a self-professed sorceress with a secret agenda of her own gives him a pill to magically heal the bones.

Max quickly discovers the local dog park. It's an odd, private little world--a preserve for neighborhood crackpots and lay-abouts, and, incidentally, their dogs.

What happened to Amy? The dog park club has brewed up a theory.

359397,1001441,The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male,eng,"Fifteen years ago, when it was first published, ""The Transsexual Empire"" challenged the medical psychiatric definition of transsexualism as a disease and sex conversion hormones and surgery as the cure. It exposed the antifeminist stereotyping that requires candidates for transsexual surgery to prove themselves by conforming to subjective, outdated and questionable feminine roles and ""passing"" as women. Then as now, defining and treating transsexualism as a medical problem prevents the person experiencing so-called gender dissatisfaction from seeing it in a gender-challenging or feminist framework. Transsexualism goes to the question of what gender is, how to challenge it, and what reinforces gender stereotyping in a role-defined society. In the new introduction to this feminist work, Raymond discusses how these same issues are now debated in the context of transgender. Transgenderism reduces gender resistance to wardrobes, hormones, surgery and posturing - anything but real sexual equality. It assimilates the roles and definitions of masculinity and femininity, often mixing and matching, but never really moving beyond both.
In a similar way, transsexualism is thought to be a radical challenge to gender roles, breaking the boundaries of gender and transgressing its rigid lines. But if the transsexual merely exchanges one gender role for another, and if the outcome of such a sex reassignment is to endorse a femininity which, in many transsexuals, becomes a caricature of much that feminists have rejected about many-made femininity, then where is the challenge, the transgression, and the breaking of any real boundaries? This book will be used as a text in women's studies, psychology, sociology, technology and public policy, as well as by medical students, law students, and all who have an interest in feminist issues.","['747417', '823882', '1022', '1059288', '1266558', '79460', '304083', '1209346', '1218235', '370065', '419169', '7989737', '11497719', '44546', '280880']",81.0,264.0,21.0,2.24,0.061595822617221456,0.05387724822776621,0.06192471711719227,1.0,1.0,0.05634344040159897,0.06220256273423189,0.060158678069189536,1.0,0.05526035015364953,0.0670692813395226,1.0,0.04048762028533238,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Their spy networks in Tehran have been compromised, the operation brought to a halt, and British Intelligence have been called in to help in the form of Ryder and British spy networks operating in the Iranian capital.
In a separate operation unknown to both the Americans and the British, Israeli intelligence have sent their own Special Forces into the same remote region of the Zagros Mountains. They have been given orders to seek out and destroy a potential Iranian secret missile base that is likely to threaten the State.
Both teams are captured by the Iranians before they reach their targets, but they manage to escape, together with a group of Iranian insurgents. Despite the desperate circumstances they find themselves in, Ryder, the Americans and the insurgents agree to accompany the Israelis in their search for the missile base.
Met with a series of hazardous escapades, hardship and privations in their search through the rugged Zagros range, pursued by the enemy, will they find a secret base? Will they be able to destroy the base if found despite an unexpected and shocking revelation which seriously threatens the whole operation. Will they be too late to save the State of Israel from a nuclear holocaust?
Run With The Brave is the thrilling sequel to Paths of Courage and will appeal to fans of the first book in the 'Frank Ryder' series. Mike Woodhams breaks out of the confines of a city setting and moves into a more hostile environment in this brutal, objective and realistic story that will be enjoyed by espionage, mystery and crime readers.

549142,4452520,Flesh is Heir: An Historical Romance,eng,"Lincoln Kirstein is well known as the founding director of the New York City Ballet, for his writings on dance, photography, painting, and sculpture. Known to few readers, however, is this early (1932)work, his only published novel, autobiographical in content but historical in scope and purpose.
In a revealing Afterword, Mr. Kirstein recalls his family background and education as well as the circumstances surrounding the writing of his novel. Family wealth and the ""permissive generosity"" of his parents gave him familiarity with ""a fraction of literary London, the main European museums, plus Northern Italy, Spain, and North Africa"" by the time he had completed his college education. He thus possessed a unique view, which inspired him ""to write an 'historical' novel which would utilize what I knew and felt about my own times in as pictorial a fashion as I might muster.""
Flesh is Heir is the story of a boy who serves as the type of the first generation arising in the United States after World War I.

A light romance book - titled The Sandy Shore - has many borrowers, some interesting, some dull. The book tells his own story and gives you snapshots of their lives as he sees them as borrowers. One borrower (Anne) buys it when the library closes in 1966. The character in the romance (Sandra) seeks new horizons in her fictional life and this resonates with Anne and she decides to do likewise in her real life. She awaits what chance serves up, like flotsam and jetsam on the shore where she lives in Pembrokeshire. She talks to Sandra as an intimate diary and to the book itself which, in her mind, becomes a personality (Book). An affair with an old boyfriend (Nelson) from Royal Navy days when she was a WRNS in a local naval station (Kete) has dramatic consequences.
The affair ends with an almighty bust-up when she realises he is as rotten as her navy friend naughty Christina always said he was. There is then a long period of normality and she continues as a normal happily married woman. However, the past has a habit of catching up with you and does so half a lifetime later with dramatic consequences for Anne and for Book.

353098,27191391,The Door to His Darkness,eng,"Dear Author,
In my world there are two ruling bodies; Demons and Shifters. My father is a Demon Lord but I'm Half Incubus and Half Warlock. My horns show my station as a demon, however, my different colored eyes show my dual blood. Because of my dual blood, there is a dark power inside me. I fear this power, and my father has kept me sheltered as he would destroy anyone who tried to use this darkness for their personal gain.
While at The Gathering, where all beings in power come together once every 100 years, I met someone. He's a Lycan and he's the most beautiful being I've ever seen. One night of passion is hardly anything to an Incubus like me but it was the most special night I had ever had. We both had a connection like no other, and to top it off, my taking of his life force did nothing but invigorate him.
As the son of a prestigious Lycan family, there is no way our union would be allowed with a half like me. When we are discovered, we're torn apart. When I hear of my beautiful Lycan being publicly punished by his family for tarnishing the family name, the darkness that I have so tried to keep locked away, is unleashed. I will not allow the one who has finally brought me peace and happiness to be hurt. Now everyone will learn of the monster we fought to conceal.

245885,15711483,Fools And Knaves: The True Story Of My Historic Presidential Campaign,eng,"FOOLS AND KNAVES: THE TRUE STORY OF MY HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, a political humor novel, is told to the author (and the reader) by fictional presidential candidate, Jim Johnson
Jim Johnson is an odd, cranky and wealthy retired Seattle businessman who serves on corporate boards. He gets into hot water when the press learns that one of his companies never paid a penny in taxes. Then a disgruntled employee leaks to the press that Johnson took personal tax deductions for depreciating his wife. Johnson defends himself by attacking his critics, suggesting that corporate values statements reveal the problem with companies today: They care more about integrity and quality than about making money.
Johnson receives what he thinks is his fifteen minutes of unwanted fame. A few days later, he comments on an article about whether the candidates for President are religious enough to hold the office. Johnson tops them all by claiming he's nine times more religious, feigning belief in nine gods. ""They believe in only one supernatural force for which there is no evidence,"" Johnson states. ""I believe in nine supernatural forces for which there is no evidence. Who has more faith?""
He is instantly anointed as a fresh personality in the Presidential sweepstakes. His new high profile lands him on Meet the Press, where he says more outrageous things including proposing Money (That's What I Want) as the new national anthem. Surprisingly, the voters agree that the Star Spangled Banner has lousy lyrics and is unsingable. Of course, Johnson has no intention of running for President....
Until his proposal to form two new political parties, The Fools and The Knaves, is embraced by the voters. Johnson often knew that Governor X or Representative Y was either a fool or a knave, but could not tell which. With the new parties in place, now they must declare their allegiances.
When Herman Cain, Michele Bachman, Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, and Ron Paul are presidential candidates, you might wonder if political satire is possible. The book's candidates -- from the pedantic President Bupka, who lectures the nation on word etymologies and proper pronunciation, to Senator Winthrop, who poll tests his faxes to God, to wealthy Voras Lucre, who refers to himself as The Magnificent One, to Liz Hatter, famous for killing her husband on reality TV Show Getting Away With Murder (Bravo had pre-negotiated immunity), to Johnson himself, who introduces ""fresh ideas"", such as two new economic indicia--The Cost of Living In Style (COLIS) and The Cost Of Living Like Pond Scum (COLPS) -- manage to be more venal, outrageous, and funnier than today's politicians.
As the economy careens from the Great Deflation Fear to the Great Panic, and the military mission to Greater Transcaucustania becomes ensnared in ethnic feuds between Chechens, Abkhazians, Balkars, Kazakhs, Nalkars, Turkmen, Armenians, Kabardians, Inguish, Dungans, Azerbaijanis, Dagestanis Karachays, Kalmyks, Kyrgyz, Lak, Lezgi, Tabasaran, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Cherkess, Dargins, and endless other groups, scandals entrap leading candidates, and Johnson finds himself ahead in the polls, until questions about his background arise.
Did he really inspect his neighbor's garbage? Worship terrorist gods? Cheat at golf? Use a French auto mechanic? Consistently lie to a Catholic Priest during his childhood confessions?
Will Big B, the obnoxious Fox News conspiracy theorist and now the Knave candidate, use slurs and innuendo to defeat Johnson as he did with the others?

Successfully ensconced at a famous salon on Madison Avenue, he now wants to see his lover get ahead. The problem is, gorgeous Ricky Hart has strayed from building on past achievements as an actor. He's lost touch with his passion to build a career as a Broadway performer and now works as a bartender. Stuck in a rut of sleeping all day after partying all night, he's ceased going to classes and auditions; even his agent has abandoned interest in helping him. While Bobby means well, his attempt to jolt Ricky into action by pointing out this backward slide only serves as a wedge in their relationship. One of Bobby's biggest clients, however, is a powerful casting director, and Bobby promises Ricky the opportunity to show the woman his talent. Now, Ricky must dig down into his soul and sharpen the edge he's lost over the past year. It's up to him to avoid liquor and his wayward buddies devoid of ambition. He, alone, can discipline himself to study his craft and get back in shape for a career that depends on it. As Ricky prepares for the rigors of auditioning, Bobby receives inside information about a major production of Hair being cast. As it happens, Ricky has dreamed of playing one of the lead roles in that show for more than half his life! He focuses as he never has before, and prepares with diligence to win the part. Loyal to the man he adores, Bobby chooses to put aside his own needs while awaiting the outcome of Ricky's efforts.

I flinched, waiting for a blow that didn't come. There was just cold air on my bare, exposed skin. Oh Christ, what was I doing? Standing naked, bent over a rubber mattress in a room with a man that was at least twenty years older than me, that was what. Not quite what I'd expected when I got up for college this morning.
Suddenly I felt a finger slide between my legs, then two. Mr Garritson felt for my clitoris and began to stroke it so gently that it was almost painful. I pushed down slightly to increase the friction, and he laughed quietly.

409644,4859308,Can You See God in This Picture?: A Letter to My Sons Making Sense of 25 Years as a Pastor,eng,"Growing up in the church often lacks the beauty and meaning that God envisioned. John King s ministry as a pastor and teacher spanned the years from 1969 to 1993. He and his family moved 17 times in those years, and pastored in five churches, once even moving several times while at the same church. Occasionally down to the last jar of peanut butter, faith played a real part in their spiritual journey. And then there were the children. With nary a negative word for the adults, Can You See God in This Picture? tells the story of what passion for God can accomplish, both constructively and destructively, and explores the angry and stupid things adults do in the church, which children see and remember. Written as a letter to his three sons, and with many personal admissions and anecdotes, this memoir has the potential to bless any whose faith has been tested, perhaps even destroyed, through church power struggles, theological bickering, political infighting, and all the other things that burn out even the good pastors and sometimes even force them out of the pulpit. Pastor King was known in Western Pennsylvania for his knowledge of Koine Greek and Classical Hebrew, having taught in Western PA Bible Institute in Butler, The Lighthouse Ministry in Washington, and Faith Seminary in Bethel Park, PA in the 1970 s. He also taught at the Charismatic Conference in 1979 at Duquesne University. He graduated from a four year ministerial program at Northeast Bible College, which is now Valley Forge Christian College, and later returned to complete a course of study for a B.S. in Bible. In 1982, he received a Master of Bible Theology from the International Bible Institute & Seminary. Currently retired from the pastorate, he develops computer software at a financial- services firm in Boston and lives with his wife in their townhouse in a nearby town. He occasionally speaks at area churches, including the one he regularly attends, and he still harbors the dream of someday perhaps returning to professional ministry.",[],3.0,208.0,3.0,2.33,0.12975082658367543,0.13318292669566026,0.11641838833800323,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.14075709450850032,0.12781553521917693,0.11118360863942887,0.12180364315727925,0.13967751822544003,0.08485554854525,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Someone once told thirteen year old Ellie Bridge that she should always listen to what her grandmother had to say, there was a lot of truth in it. Given that most of Gran's stories were war memories and refugee tales from her life in Port Albion, it was easy to just nod politely without really listening. That's what most people did. If she had listened though, she might have been better prepared for the incredible and terrifying events that were about to engulf Ellie and her family in the small, run down town of Bellingham.
Life in Bellingham was dull, and growing up with a ridiculously strict stepfather whose personal mission in life was to ensure that Ellie had no friends, no excitement and no life made it duller. With restrictions on facebook, no phone (at least not one that he knew of) and strict rules about who she was allowed to be friends with, meant that anything concerned with local myths, stories and Gran's memories was never going to the highest thing on Ellie's agenda.
So when her eleven year old brother Danny comes home excited one Hallowe'en claiming to have seen a UFO in the Bellingham Woods, Ellie dismisses it as nothing more than the overactive imagination of an irritating younger brother. But a chain of events has been initiated by Danny's claim that is at once both unstoppable and terrifying. Ellie, her friend Shresta and Danny soon find that far from being ordinary, uninteresting children in just another dull town, they are suddenly the focus of unwelcome interest from a brutal and profit hungry mining corporation, a group of religious zealots and a band of ideological fanatics.

151333,18220961,The British in Bengal 1756-1773: A Society in Transition Seen Through the Biography of a Rebel - William Bolts,eng,"In 1756, the Company became the principal political power in Bengal. This position would be strengthened after 1764 and was finally openly acknowledged and confirmed during the government of Warren Hastings between 1772 and 1785.
The British, however, were not newcomers on the Indian scene. They were either the servants of that great trading organization known as the East India Company or lived there under its protection. The East India Company had been trading in India ever since the seventeenth century and had started setting up their Calcutta settlement on the eve of the eighteenth century. The Company's settlements were governed by a President and his Council, almost always made up of servants with the greatest length of service and exercising a virtually absolute power over their subjects by virtue of a Royal Charter. This small community of merchants, trading for their masters in London as well as for their own good fortune, was the driving force behind the British rise to power in Bengal.
Whereas increased British power in Bengal significantly enhanced the prospects of profit for both the Company and its servants, it also presented them with increased administrative responsibility. The existing administrative structure of the Company was severely put under strain by the political developments in Bengal as well as by the reactions of its servants thereto, who were quick to perceive new prospects for personal gain.
It would not be long before the old administrative structure of the Company in India would be contested from within by its own servants. The call for reform was raised early indeed and the first sketches of plans for the better government of the British possessions in Bengal appeared even before a great credit crisis in 1772 threatened the Company's very existence and finally induced Government to propose what would become the Regulating Act of 1773.
The author of the book proposes a micro-historical approach to analyse this process by exploring the career of William Bolts. Bolts was a junior servant on the Company's Bengal establishment during this crucial period, whose entrepreneurial energy and skill soon gave him an importance in private trade rivalling that of his superiors in the service. Political power and importance in trade were closely connected under the Bengal circumstances of the time and Bolts' very success therefore put the old hierarchical administrative structure of the Company under strain. In trying to bring Bolts' stature in private trade back one in accordance with his position in the Company's service, the Governor and Council of Bengal first provoked Bolts' resistance to their orders before causing him to attack its members before the courts of justice in Calcutta. Exasperated by his defiance of their authority, they finally resorted to measures of doubtful legality to have him deported from the settlement and put him on a boat to Europe. Bolts, however, continued his fight in London where he managed to draw the attention of the public to what were then called ""India Affairs"" with his publications and his orchestration of the legal pursuit of Governor Verelst by his former Armenian agents before the London courts.
If the roles of individual characters in the process of the expansion of British power in Bengal has been highlighted in previous works, the present book provides a close inquest into their public and private motivations. It also shows that the issue of how Bengal, and later India, should be ruled was raised very early in the history of British dominance there. Bolts' views on the matter, exposed in his two voluminous ""Considerations on India Affairs"", proposed an alternative to the authoritarian bureaucracy that was being put into place by Hastings and his successors and by which India would be ruled until well into the twentieth century. This reality of the Raj caused Bolts' views and testimony to be stamped as self-interested or at times even as ""unbritish"". The present book shows that Bolts' career shows much of the strains and tensions to which British rule was subjected from within. Bolts analysed them with genuine insight and his views and ideas are of real interest to the reader taking an interest in ideas about Empire and the history of early British rule in India.",[],1.0,305.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0769134802924144,0.09023262431293214,1.0,0.07969250353134125,0.08297220682798423,1.0,0.06719895646609789,0.07694314288509066,0.0714948745804239,0.08126180914263455,0.08237256844802263,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK
The Amazing Spider-Man
1. To the extent that you cover a superhero origin story, I'd recommend focusing on things and approaches we haven't seen much of before. I think it would have helped to either spend less time covering the origin story or make it more different than Spider-Man 1. That said, I thought ASM's approach to the death of Uncle Ben was smoother and more thematically effective-when Peter has the opportunity to stop the robber, there's a plausible and immediate threat to bystanders. Peter declines and Ben gets killed seconds thereafter. This makes Peter's motivation for a life-changing decision (becoming a superhero) more plausible. In contrast, in Spider-Man 1, Peter gets torn up because he doesn't get involved in a relatively minor situation with a police officer present, with only a faint connection between Peter Parker letting the robber go and the robber killing a civilian.
1.1. Peter plays a more active role acquiring superpowers. He was only in the laboratory because he stole an ID and figured out how to thwart a keypad. I think the scene develops him more than just getting lucky at the science fair in Spider-Man 1. (Likewise, he makes his own webslingers instead of getting them from the spider-bite).
2. Beware the idiot ball - make sure there are believable consequences to actions. Peter Parker displayed his superpowers in public so many times that I think his classmates would have to be idiots not to notice something was amiss. (For example, the NBA-caliber dunk? Or breaking a goalpost with a football? Or lifting enormous Flash Thompson by the neck?) When characters make decisions, there should be consequences. For example, if the character is reckless with his powers, maybe other characters come closer to figuring out what's going on. Or at least start asking difficult questions.
3. Speaking of consequences, I thought the crane scene was kind of cute. (Peter saves a construction worker's kid and the construction worker later pulls in favors at the climax to help Spider-Man). It helps build a contrast between Spider-Man's decidedly limited means and, say, the lavishly-funded Avengers or X-Men. I think it's also a more subtle and effective way of showing he's more of an everyman hero than we saw in previous Spider-Man movies (e.g. subway passengers throwing themselves between Dr. Octopus and a crippled Spidey felt sort of hokey to me).

The Comics of Charles Schulzcollects new essays on the work of the creator of the immensely popular Peanutscomic strip. Despite Schulz's celebrity, few scholarly books on his work and career have been published. This collection serves as a foundation for future study not only of Charles Schulz (1922-2000) but, more broadly, of the understudied medium of newspaper comics.
Schulz's Peanutsran for a half century, during which time he drew the strip and its characters to express keen observations on postwar American life and culture. As Peanuts'popularity grew, Schulz had opportunities to shape the iconography, style, and philosophy of modern life in ways he never could have imagined when he began the strip in 1950. Edited by leading scholars Jared Gardner and Ian Gordon, this volume ranges over a spectrum of Schulz's accomplishments and influence, touching on everything from cartoon aesthetics to the marketing of global fast food. Philosophy, ethics, and cultural history all come into play. Indeed, the book even highlights Snoopy's global reach as American soft power.
As the broad interdisciplinary range of this volume makes clear, Peanutsoffers countless possibilities for study and analysis. From many perspectives--including childhood studies, ethnic studies, health and exercise studies, as well as sociology--The Comics of Charles Schulzoffers the most comprehensive and diverse study of the most influential cartoonist during the second half of the twentieth century.",[],6.0,234.0,6.0,2.33,0.10095855904676103,0.10073687215987763,0.08907054388689598,1.0,1.0,0.11086393321075376,0.11207366496243092,1.0,0.0818032584647678,0.10169283785360979,0.08539294520331,1.0,0.0705539075593657,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
332679,18131249,Boudicca,eng,"Brittania was the most recent, and westerly province of the Roman Empire. Mostly pacified, and stable. Secure under Roman rule.
In A.D. 61, King Prasutagus, of the Iceni, had died, leaving two daughters, and his widow, Boudicca, known later by the latin name of Boadicea. She now ruled as Queen of the Iceni. The kingdom, situated in East Anglia, had been a friendly client state, the Romans having agreed to some autonomy. This was about to change. While the Governor, General Suetonius Paulinus was away, fighting the Druids, and their affiliated tribesmen, in North Wales, Decianus Catus, the Procurator, had been left in charge. His extreme treatment of the Iceni, led to subjucation, and the rape of Boudicca's daughters, and, when she protested, the scourging and lashing of Boudicca herself. An atrocity that turned the Iceni into uproar, revolt, and a thirst for bloody revenge.
Boudicca, at the head of one hundred and thirty thousand, well armed, warriors, was now imposing the biggest threat to the Romans, since the slave revolt of Spartacus. With their forces split between England and Wales, the Romans faced, not only annihilation, but, being swept back into the sea.
The Roman cities of Camulodinum, Verulamium, and Londinium, lay before the warrior Queen. Her blood lust, even threatened to turn into longings of a different kind.
The Iceni had been joined by the Trinovantes, with their leader, Denophias, a shrewd, and calculating, man.
The Iceni, were also well served by their nobles, particularly, Cembanus. Also, the Iceni warrior, and, now, ex-sheepherder, Unatrax, so muscle bound, and a formidable wielder of the Iceni long sword, he became known as Unatrax the Strong.
Paulinus, and the Tribune, Julius Agricola, a Gaul, of merit, and the legionaries from the Fourteenth, and Twentieth Legions, tried their best to hurry back with all haste. The nearest legion to the uprising, was the Ninth Hispana, led by the young Legate, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, garrisoned at the fortress of Lindum. But, were his five thousand legionaries of the Ninth, plus auxiliaries, a match for Boudicca's one hundred and thirty thousand, revenge-seeking tribesmen, and their four hundred, scythed, Iceni war chariots?",[],2.0,161.0,1.0,2.33,1.0,1.0,0.10040058763614268,0.07270081595794349,0.11130222853677972,0.08611425750127466,1.0,1.0,0.10316708768780783,0.068165605148993,0.09075563191554946,0.10013845849583487,0.1034872208319722,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tired of competing with the television for his attention, Candice feels that after six years of marriage, they might be drawing apart.
That is until Piers sets her up with Trevor, one of their closest friends who also just happens to be a certifiable Dom. What she doesn't expect to find is her husband acting as a butler let alone participating once Trevor's done with her.

Beattie, like many of her generation, dismissed Richard Nixon's wife: ""interchangeable with a Martian,"" she said. Decades later, she wonders what it must have been like to be married to such a spectacularly ambitious and catastrophically self-destructive man.
Drawing on a wealth of sources from Life magazine to accounts by Nixon's daughter and his doctor to The Haldeman Diaries and Jonathan Schell's The Time of Illusion, Beattie reconstructs dozens of scenes in an attempt to see the world from Mrs. Nixon's point of view. Like Stephen King's On Writing, this fascinating and intimate account offers readers a rare glimpse into the imagination of a writer.
Beattie, whose fiction Vanity Fair calls ""irony-laced reports from the front line of the baby boomers' war with themselves,"" packs insight and humor into her examination of the First Couple with whom boomers came of age. Mrs. Nixon is a startlingly compelling and revelatory work.","['638188', '10238101', '8105645', '2713623', '381442', '13395627', '11104065', '805601', '713816', '10706657', '321110', '430600', '2267903', '2216931', '9109649', '60046', '7016276']",177.0,304.0,61.0,2.41,0.11160745971240045,0.107154843972485,0.10364933327326532,1.0,1.0,0.09773896567948759,0.11308242679459769,1.0,0.09710289732455787,0.0969112820822551,0.1074519513396704,1.0,0.10800260416198583,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Life Enthusiasm: A Path to Purpose Beyond Recovery details how life force energy can propel the most desperate addict down a path to freedom and meaning. Through the application of Universal Energy the author discovers his intuitive voice and transcends a four decade entrenchment in addictive behavior in just eighteen months.
The element that gives the story its unique voice while imbuing it with a mystical and adventurous tone is the employment of energetic treatments or transfers to treat addiction and anxiety.
The undeniable power of Universal Energy to amplify and enhance one's spiritual progression to a state of freedom is the step that many people who have been frozen by anxiety or dependent behaviors have been looking for.
The story includes the author's experience of other dimensions of existence, sound healing, distance healing and various energy modalities.
This is a true story of the author's rise from apathy, self-pity, and victimization to an addiction-free state of life purpose and sovereignty. A vision ignites and illuminates a buried passion that must find expression ultimately through an enthusiastic and abstinent voice. The tension builds until the author must face the greatest obstacle on his path; full acknowledgement and ownership of the core deceit that blocks the completion of his purpose. It is in the sacred space of common experience where author and reader meet that solutions to any problem may be discovered. The book's final chapter summarizes the main elements necessary for others to find the freedom they seek.

Unfortunately, everything comes to an end when her beloved soldier mysteriously disappeared. She keeps a bittersweet memory of him until she is found dead from an overdose of sleeping pills, by her housekeeper Eunice Murray.
45 years later, Helen Price is a typical young woman with recurrent dreams about a certain time and place that she finds familiar but she can't explain why. She dreams of herself being Marilyn Monroe and she feels a strong love towards a man she doesn't even know; she has only seen him in her dreams. She believes that he's somewhere waiting for her, even though she had never physically met him. She waits and yearns for a love that never comes, hope becomes her only caress. Eventually, she realizes that it's better to have never met him in her dreams than to wake and reach for hands that are not there. To escape the fiery passion, she runs into the arms of Richard, an affluent lawyer. However, she miserably fails. His enigmatic absence sharpens the romantic emotions she feels for him, and she's unable to share intimacy with Richard because the stranger's face keeps dancing through her mind.

In this penetrating and provocative study, Sika A. Dagbovie-Mullins adds a new dimension to this dialogue as she investigates the ways in which various mixed-race writers and public figures have redefined both OC blacknessOCO and OC whitenessOCO by invoking multiple racial identities.
aaa Focusing on several key novelsOCoNella LarsenOCOs Quicksand (1928), Lucinda RoyOCOs Lady Moses (1998), and Danzy SennaOCOs Caucasia (1998)OCoas well as memoirs by Obama, James McBride, and Rebecca Walker and the personae of singer Mariah Carey and actress Halle Berry, Dagbovie-Mullins challenges conventional claims about biracial identification with a concept she calls OC black-sentient mixed-race identity.OCO Whereas some multiracial organizations can diminish blackness by, for example, championing the inclusion of multiple-race options on census forms and similar documents, a black-sentient consciousness stresses a perception rooted in blacknessOCoOC a connection to a black consciousness, OCO writes the author, OC that does not overdetermine but still plays a large role in oneOCOs racial identification.OCO By examining the nuances of this concept through close readings of fiction, memoir, and the public images of mixed-race celebrities, Dagbovie-Mullins demonstrates how a OC black-sentient mixed-race identity reconciles the widening separation between black/white mixed race and blackness that has been encouraged by contemporary mixed-race politics and popular culture.OCO
aaa A book that promises to spark new debate and thoughtful reconsiderations of an especially timely topic, Crossing B(l)ack recognizes and investigates assertions of a black-centered mixed-race identity that does not divorce a premodern racial identity from a postmodern racial fluidity.

Synopsis:
""20#6 AD. Following the discovery of the genuine Dead Sea Scrolls, women get to learn it's a tampered-with version of the Old Testament which was used to keep their foremothers in submission for nearly two millennia. Hilarity fails to ensue.
After a first, scorned, attempt at enforcing the female-friendly newfound teachings, the not-so-weaker gender ends up revolting and snatching the reins of the US administration from the callous hands of Patriarchy. Two novelties will be born out of their reforms towards a healthy and peaceful society: the Collar, an electronic device for suppressing violent impulses in men, and the Pool, the State-run dating service for women.
The first Anniversary of the Revolution is now only a few days away. As the head of the Department of Information, Lisa Fenrich is all too aware of the stakes for her government. What she's about to discover is that the holes she's been plugging were trifles compared to the one about to open under her feet.
Disgraced yet unbowed, she will set out on a quest to recover the last secret fragment of the Holy Scriptures. One that would spell the end of the age-old rift between men and women if revealed to the world, but that the Presidentess she so staunchly supports intends to tweak around for her political survival; and maybe more.",[],8.0,310.0,5.0,2.5,1.0,1.0,0.15174550886619664,0.12638280233401963,1.0,0.13058430292669132,0.156613768878776,0.14261625815721427,0.1566350400193965,0.10631812275629844,0.15189333659499332,1.0,0.11947936096247708,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

103162,2574850,Coming Out Straight: Understanding and Healing Homosexuality,eng,"Richard Cohen, a former homosexual, now married with three children, struggled for most of his life with unwanted same-sex attractions. He tried desperately to find professionals who understood his condition and help him heal. Because ""it was so difficult to explain myself to therapists, who didn't have a clue,"" Cohen eventually became a psychotherapist and developed both a groundbreaking understanding of same-sex attractions and a comprehensive treatment plan for healing homosexuality. ""Coming Out Straight"" not only details Cohen's personal journey out of homosexuality but also recounts his experiences helping thousands of men, women and adolescents heal their gender identity. Recoginizing that the ""gay rights movement"" has done a great service in bringing the issue of homosexuality of the closet and into the light, Cohen points out that in the name of tolerance, society has now succumbed to acceptance. ""If we embrace someone's homosexuality as normal and natural, their potential for wholeness will remain dormant beneath their emotional wounds. It's not bad to have same-sex attractions, as they represent a drive to heal unmet love needs. However, acting upon them leads to frustration and pain."" 
In simple language, ""Coming Out Straight"" presents the basic causes of same-sex attractions, a clear model for recovery, and stories of individuals who made the change. The book has three parts: In Part I, the author shares his own story and the root causes of same-sex attractions. Part II presents a four-stage model of recovery and healing. Part III discusses the healing of homophobia by overcoming fear and hatred of homosexuality. 
While the book is meant to educate therapists, clergy, and other professionals, it also assists those who struggle with their own same-sex attractions as well as their loved ones. ""Coming Out Straight"" sets forth an easy to understand primer on homosexuality, both for family members and friends of homosexuals, as well as for the general public. It will open the door to a new, happier, and fulfilling heterosexual life.","['958263', '6324600', '10913101', '23208863', '25450997', '12393909', '18666404', '15871121', '10432892', '7422957', '22596955', '26234490', '11349877', '23306734', '17555771', '87564', '24379183', '22716439']",295.0,292.0,97.0,1.73,0.12184718738856756,0.12116356939822083,0.12341067522986479,1.0,1.0,0.12408534082431043,0.13005728558063157,1.0,0.11815428368904228,0.11291692168561633,0.12259069434807131,1.0,0.09826310060491329,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

She uses unorthodox methods to improve the lives of elective mutes and truants, plus children who are aggressive, have been abused or are suffering from eating disorders. Dr Lawrence takes some kids skinny dipping; others she gives sessions with Harry, an African Grey parrot also on the staff, together with Arthur, a Basset Hound. Along with her slightly unusual treatments, she also gives her patients responsibilities to overcome their traumas.
""That's the beauty of Rousay. We are the safety net. They find a freedom they never had before. Domestic, imagined, and abusive pressures are suspended, not necessarily resolved. What we are doing is lighting tapers. One day some flicker of flame might just burn out the stubborn daemon that's lodged deep in their minds.""

As the traumas of Angie's early life and the demons of her past are explored, Sam struggles more and more to understand the methods in her madness.

In the storm of chaos that follows, his actions turn him into a legendary hero. The more renowned he gets, the closer the source of evil is drawn to him.

445031,364784,Lesbian Images,eng,"Believing that love is best described in a work of art, Jane Rule has chosen for this study of lesbianism the work of brilliantly articulate lesbian writers such as Gertrude Stein, Colette, Vita Sachville West and Willa Cather. Her concern is to discover what images of lesbians these and other lesbian writers have portrayed in fiction, biography and autobiography -- and in particular how they were influenced by religious and psychological concepts as well as their own personal experience in presenting their lesbian characters. Besides revealing the courage of these women in a hostile environment she examines the negative morality in the minds of some of them and reassesses their ideas from a feminist standpoint.
In her introductory chapters the author looks at the way love between women has been viewed by society from ancient times to the present; how the Christian church treated both male and female inversion as a punishable sin; and how psychiatry evolved out of the same ancient prejudices that cripple the church. What was ""sin"" became ""sickness"" and ""punishment"" was replaced with ""treatment"". In her final chapter Jane Rule looks at the dramatic changes that came about with the advent of the women's movement and the occasionally bitter and painful infighting among lesbians and feminists -- expressing ultimately a feeling of hope and optimism for a more positive future.",[],30.0,246.0,3.0,3.41,0.07574114895498538,0.07184354523396103,0.07125838568703831,1.0,1.0,0.062471941964432155,1.0,0.08511997770945276,0.08216315924315226,0.07483306111772758,0.08749456756125458,1.0,0.055578271190954,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

From Kirkus Reviews:
A fun-filled tale of new beginnings, sudden endings and the lighter side of the daily grind.
After a professional and personal meltdown in Orange County, Louisa ""Lulu"" Hallstrom packs her things and returns home to Seattle. With her $80,000-a-year job firmly in the rearview, Louisa takes the first job available--an entry-level admin position working for a lazy, mentally unbalanced boss. In desperate need of an apartment, Louisa hooks up with an old college friend who has morphed into a slovenly, militant environmentalist with a horrifying lack of domestic skills and hygiene. Louisa, her love life in similar shambles, finds herself at the mercy of online dating and its resulting grotesqueries. Her bad luck is compounded when she finds the body of a co-worker and becomes a suspect, a misfortune that's surpassed by another concern: She might be the next victim. The engaging, unwitting Louisa helps first-time author Reinke successfully capture the fresh style of a light, well-paced mystery, impressively rendered with interesting, multidimensional characters. Reinke's humorous, witty voice is accessorized by easygoing and accessible prose. Despite a few imperfections--slightly contrived dialogue, for example--Reinke wisely refrains from getting too fancy with inorganic plot twists; instead, she simply lets the story speak for itself. Louisa is a funny, endearing, self-deprecating and, above all, relatable heroine, whom just about every woman can relate to as she navigates a turbulent life, with a few laughs along the way. Hopefully we'll be hearing more soon from Reinke and Louisa.
A refreshing, humorous read that strikes a winning balance between chick lit and light mystery.

149568,17899706,The Apartment,eng,"One snowy December morning in an old European city, an American man leaves his shabby hotel to meet a local woman who has agreed to help him search for an apartment to rent. THE APARTMENT follows the couple across a blurry, illogical, and frozen city into a past the man is hoping to forget, and leaves them at the doorstep of an uncertain future--their cityscape punctuated by the man's lingering memories of time spent in Iraq and the life he abandoned in the United States. Contained within the details of this day is a complex meditation on America's relationship with the rest of the world, an unflinching glimpse at the permanence of guilt and despair, and an exploration into our desire to cure violence with violence.
A novel about how our relationships to others--and most importantly to ourselves--alters how we see the world, THE APARTMENT perfectly captures the peculiarity and excitement of being a stranger in a strange city. Written in an affecting and intimate tone that gradually expands in scope, intensity, poetry, and drama, Greg Baxter's clear-eyed first novel tells the intriguing story of these two people on this single day. Both beguiling and raw in its observations and language, THE APARTMENT is a crisp novel with enormous range that offers profound and unexpected wisdom.","['17707742', '18114470', '15842268', '17456963', '18465579', '16158520', '16136813', '17286752', '18371508', '17707706', '243593', '16066880', '18679923', '16059559', '18635096', '23282017', '26201833']",1488.0,193.0,277.0,3.03,1.0,0.1903462051141458,0.19606267238808628,0.18729857876902345,1.0,0.16532737686263752,1.0,0.1818454942352478,0.18648158338369414,0.1463754783493525,0.19310203732114228,1.0,0.14646234380978598,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Such is the state of mind of Ann Radcliffe's orphaned heroine Emily St Aubert, who finds herself imprisoned in her evil guardian Count Montoni's gloomy medieval fortress in the remote Appenines. Terror is the order of the day inside the walls of Udolpho, as Emily struggles against Montoni's rapacious schemes and the threat of her own psychological disintegration.
A bestseller in its day and a potent influence on Sade, Poe, and other writers, The Mysteries of Udolpho(1794) is Radcliffe's classic work of Gothic fiction. With its dream-like plot and hallucinatory rendering of its characters' psychological states, the novel remains a profound and fascinating challenge to modern readers.

Life has taught her that lesson the hard way...nothing is ever simple, and people bring complications she just doesn't need.
But she's a soldier in an army--a rather unique one--and when her partner, Rip, goes down in the line of duty, there's no question of what she has to do. Stay with him, nurse him back to health...admire that nice, long...no, no, no...that's not part of the job description at all.
Too bad she can't seem to help herself.

Now comes the highly anticipated sequel to her Kate Fansler novel, Honest Doubt, which the ProvidenceJournalcalled ""one of [her] best books in years."" Here, Cross takes her beloved protagonist into uncharted territory, turning Kate Fansler's world upside down.
Just when Kate Fansler thinks life couldn't possibly hold any more surprises, she receives a phone call from Laurence, the eldest of her imperious brothers. But a woman as sharp as Kate knows that the moment one stops believing in life's little bends in the road is the time when it has more twists in store.
Kate has always been different from the other Fanslers-a free and independent thinker in a family where propriety and decorum are prized above all. She has always assumed it was because she was the youngest and the only girl in the family. But over a drink with Laurence, Kate's whole understanding of herself is thrown into question as he calmly tells her that a strange man came to his office claiming to be Kate's father-and it's quite possible that she is not a Fansler after all.
There are even more dangerous curves in the road for Kate Fansler, especially after she meets the man who calls himself her father. When more life-threatening secrets and lies emerge, Kate and the Fansler family are suddenly pitched perilously close to the edge of doom

If you'd like to improve your ability to learn French vocabulary by as much as 100%, 200%, even 300% (or more) ... using simple memory techniques that you can learn in 15-20 minutes (or less), then this may be the most important book that you will ever read.
Believe it or not, it really doesn't matter if you think you have a good memory or not.
The information in this book will teach you:
* Why memory is like a bicycle everyone can ride (with some minor personal adjustments).
* The real reason why no one should ever be squeamish about memorization or learning a language.
* Why and how some of the most famous memory skills are applicable to learning any language, especially French.
* How you can easily create a 26 ""letter location"" memory system based on the alphabet French shares with English.
* Unique techniques that will have you literally ""tuning in"" on the French language.
* How to separate French words in the most effective manner for memorization.
* Two secret ways you can use relaxation to aid the memorization process. These two methods alone are worth the price of this book because they will literally eliminate the stress and apprehension as you learn French.
* And much, much more ...
These techniques have been used by real language learners, most of whom previously considered themselves owners of a ""bad memory,"" to make real strides in learning French vocabulary.
Don't worry! None of these techniques are rocket science.
Frankly, if you can memorize a short email address or the name of a movie, then you can use this system to memorize a language as rich and diverse as French.
Plus, everything you'll learn in this book applies to every other language that shares the same alphabet with English. And with a little imagination, the ideas are easily transferable to other alphabet systems too.
But there's really no time to lose.
Every day that you are not using this simple vocabulary memorization system, you are literally stealing from yourself the joy of being able to read, speak and recall an abundance of French vocabulary as you easily expanded the natural abilities of your mind.",[],26.0,102.0,5.0,3.26,0.06738299095345446,0.06574393865419574,0.06084087325181206,0.06010235186087992,1.0,1.0,0.06616301378059201,1.0,0.054004499418655025,0.05357124667080103,0.06472683386400546,1.0,0.06368056396465624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Beth's father John has been to her best friend Lily everything a godchild could ask for: a protector, a friend, a better father as her own could ever be. Lily and Beth have been best friends since they were born. They share every secret, apart from one: Lily, who is almost the image of her mother, has never been in love, never longed for a boy, because she feels she belongs to one man only: John, Beth's father.
The alleged car accident four years ago that put Beth's mother in a week-long coma, did not only kill Lily's mother's and Will's wife's life, but took from John his best friend, and first love. Now, when he looks at Lily, he forces himself to see his godchild, Will's daughter, Beth's best friend and not his second chance for true love.

Most beginners' guides to great thinkers and writers offer either potted biographies or condensed summaries of their major works. How to Read, by contrast, brings the reader face to face with the writing itself in the company of an expert guide. Its starting point is that in order to get close to what a writer is all about, you have to get close to the words they actually use and be shown how to read those words. authors have been asked to select ten or so short extracts from a writer's work and look at them in detail as a way of revealing their central ideas and thereby opening the doors onto a whole world of thought. The books will not be merely a compilation of a thinker's most famous passages, their 'greatest hits', but will rather offer a series of clues or keys that will enable to reader to go on and make discoveries of their own. In addition to the texts and readings, each book will provide a short biographical chronology and suggestions for further reading, internet resources and so on. The books in the How to Read don't claim to tell you all you need to know. Instead they offer a refreshing set of first-hand meetings with those minds. Our hope is that these books will instruct, intrigue, embolden, encourage and delight. the most notorious anti-Semite in history.

229706,277966,"The Japanese Today: Change and Continuity, Enlarged Edition",eng,"With the two-thousand-year history of the Japanese experience as his foundation, Edwin O. Reischauer brings us an incomparable description of Japan today in all its complexity and uniqueness, both material and spiritual. His description and analysis present us with the paradox that is present-day Japan: thoroughly international, depending for its livelihood almost entirely on foreign trade, its products coveted everywhere--yet not entirely liked or trusted, still feared for its past military adventurism and for its current economic aggressiveness.
Reischauer begins with the rich heritage of the island nation, identifying incidents and trends that have significantly affected Japan's modern development. Much of the geographic and historical material on Japan's earlier years is drawn from his renowned study ""The Japanese,"" but the present book deepens and broadens that earlier interpretation: our knowledge of Japan has increased enormously in the intervening decade and our attitudes have become more ambivalent, while Japan too has changed, often not so subtly.
Moving to contemporary Japanese society, Reischauer explores both the constants in Japanese life and the aspects that are rapidly changing. In the section on government and politics he gives pithy descriptions of the formal workings of the various organs of government and the decision-making process, as well as the most contentious issues in Japanese life-pollution, nuclear power, organized labor-and the elusive matter of political style.
In what will become classic statements on business management and organization, Reischauer sketches the early background of trade and commerce in Japan, contrasts the struggling prewar economy with today's assertive manufacturing, and brilliantly characterizes the remarkable postwar economic miracle of Japanese heavy industry, consumer product development, and money management. In a final section, ""Japan and the World' he attempts to explain to skeptical Westerners that country's growing and painful dilemma between neutrality and alignment, between trade imbalance and ""fair"" practices, and the ever-vexing issue of that embodiment of Japanese specialness, a unique and difficult language that affects personal and national behavior.",[],49.0,459.0,5.0,3.29,1.0,0.0984713801112305,0.08223894461481965,1.0,1.0,0.08538362971086756,0.09565957607426277,1.0,0.07423355734538786,0.07497430088719224,0.07644032365372973,0.09632924810723163,0.10607270688671469,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
454789,17707611,"Masks (Masks of Aygrima, #1)",eng,"Masks, the first novel in a mesmerizing new fantasy series, draws readers into a world in which cataclysmic events have left the Autarchy of Aygrima--the one land blessed with magical resources--cut off from its former trading partners across the waters, not knowing if any of those distant peoples still live. Yet under the rule of the Autarch, Aygrima survives. And thanks to the creation of the Masks and the vigilance of the Autarch's Watchers, no one can threaten the security of the empire.
In Aygrima, magic is a Gift possessed from birth by a very small percentage of the population, with the Autarch himself the most powerful magic worker of all. Only the long-vanquished Lady of Pain and Fire had been able to challenge his rule.
At the age of fifteen, citizens are recognized as adults and must don the spell-infused Masks--which denote both status and profession--whenever they are in public. To maintain the secure rule of the kingdom, the Masks are magically crafted to reveal any treasonous thoughts or actions. And once such betrayals are exposed, the Watchers are there to enforce the law.
Mara Holdfast, daughter of the Autarch's Master Maskmaker, is fast approaching her fifteenth birthday and her all-important Masking ceremony. Her father himself has been working behind closed doors to create Mara's Mask. Once the ceremony is done, she will take her place as an adult, and Gifted with the same magical abilities as her father, she will also claim her rightful place as his apprentice.
But on the day of her Masking something goes horribly wrong, and instead of celebrating, Mara is torn away from her parents, imprisoned, and consigned to a wagon bound for the mines. Is it because she didn't turn the unMasked boy she discovered over to the Night Watchers? Or is it because she's lied about her Gift, claiming she can only see one color of magic, when in truth she can see them all, just as she could when she was a young child?
Whatever the reason, her Mask has labeled her a traitor and now she has lost everything, doomed to slavery in the mines until she dies. And not even her Gift can show Mara the future that awaits her--a future that may see her freed to aid a rebel cause, forced to become a puppet of the Autarch, or transformed into a force as dangerous to her world as the legendary Lady of Pain and Fire.","['17896116', '16613978', '18114094', '729572', '21844961', '14553894', '10718699', '21855916', '22889912', '18310299', '1921528', '15798140', '17287650', '20949421', '11041840', '17211934', '12992433', '9879358']",605.0,372.0,119.0,3.41,1.0,1.0,0.12543925287787386,0.11612207062649149,0.15068132383193533,1.0,1.0,0.12297186152253016,0.14623014098097387,0.10964023402102754,0.1349025957701538,0.1326323808095252,0.10011814359917727,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

When rumors reach the authorities that strange and excessive gourmandise is being practiced in the city of Liquorland (so named for the staggering amount of alcohol produced and consumed there), veteran special investigator Ding Gou'er is dispatched from the capital to discover the truth. His mission begins at the Mount Lou Coal Mine, where he encounters the prime suspect--Deputy Head Diamond Jin, legendary for his capacity to hold his liquor. During the ensuing drinking duel at a banquet served in Ding's honor, the investigator loses all sense of reality, and can no longer tell whether the roast suckling served is of the animal or human variety. When he finally wakes up from his stupor, he has still found no answers to his rapidly mounting questions. Worse yet, he soon finds that his trusty gun is missing. Interspersed throughout the narrative--and Ding's faltering investigation--are letters sent to Mo Yan by one Li Yidou, a doctoral candidate in Liquor Studies and an aspiring writer. Each letter contains a story that Li would like the renowned author's help in getting published. However, Li's tales, each more fantastic and malevolent than the last, soon begin alarmingly to resemble the story of Ding's continuing travails in Liquorland. Peopled by extraordinary characters--a dwarf, a scaly demon, a troupe of plump, delectable boys raised in captivity, a cookery teacher who primes her students with monstrous recipes--Mo Yan's revolutionary tour de force reaffirms his reputation as a writer of world standing. Wild, bawdy, politically explosive, and subversive, The Republic of Wineis both mesmerizing and exhilarating, proving that no repressive regime can stifle true creative imagination.","['142822', '5970590', '334970', '2077363', '139472', '818844', '903144', '321223', '590810', '3114060', '155054', '1690630', '1338084', '18465930']",23.0,368.0,2.0,3.49,1.0,1.0,0.08711091883855909,0.09938587914103085,0.10248205292231252,0.09578384236336414,1.0,1.0,0.09261156689824927,0.07423627337094764,0.09884015775748478,0.0856702451358139,0.08508826426753041,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Senator Olivia Allen--brilliant and beautiful--signs onto the Democratic presidential ticket, unaware of powerful forces that seek either to control her or destroy her.
Her opponents are Frank Kenneth Stein, a billionaire who would rather be forthright than President, and Quentin Kirby, the power-hungry, Republican vice president. As the campaign advances toward an electrifying climax, their brutal maneuvers play out against a backdrop of national crises. Hyperinflation looms and bloody riots sweep the country.

But a failed marriage, a stalled career, a judgmental ex-wife, a distant daughter, a horrid little studio apartment in the far reaches of the London suburbs-all these pathetic elements seem to pale in the chiseled face of his newest tormentor: the Twelfth Sexiest Man in the World, Josh Harper.
Josh is the star of Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know, a biographical play about Lord Byron-and Stephen is his understudy. Not only is Josh fantastically, infuriatingly good-looking, internationally renowned, and remarkably talented, he's also frustratingly healthy. No matter how many all-night booze-and-coke benders Josh goes on, he always shows up at the stage door for his call like clockwork. Stephen doubts he'll ever get his chance to slip on the puffy shirt and tight breeches of Byron and tread the boards in the role that would certainly be the break he's always waited for.
And just when Stephen's sure he couldn't resent Josh more, he meets Josh's witty, restless American wife, Nora . . . and discovers he likes her a little too much. Another man might curse his luck at finding that his potential dream woman is a rival's wife, but at this point, Stephen would expect nothing else. Caught between his stirring feelings for Nora, the demands of an insistent and secretive Josh, and his lifelong desire for a real career in show business, Stephen must make a terrible decision: Will it be the girl or the fame?

For this volume, the last page includes a list of locations where you can see a concentration of Street Art in Seattle. Aside from its rain and coffee, Seattle is known for many things subversive, from Grunge music to the activist driven WTO riots. This region of America raised the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Lee. Today, there is a culture here that is only represented anonymously in the reclaimed public spaces of the city. Images dot the urban landscape in the typical street mediums that are used across the globe: spray paint, stickers, paste-ups, stencils, wheatpasting, posters, video projection, art intervention, guerrilla art, flash mobbing, installations, post-graffiti, mosaic tiling, murals, wood-blocking, LED art, reverse-graffiti a.k.a. green-graffiti, cuprocking and yarn bombing. You will see that these are not commercial enterprises or vandalism graffiti, but individual creative statements... something we can all relate to. Street art as a medium has been popularized internationally by the likes of Shepard Fairey, Banksy, D*Face, Paul Insect, Swoon, Twist, Neck face, Faile, Space Invader and WK Interact. It can take on many purposes and sometimes involves activism, phenomenology, repetition, attention capture, culture jamming, direct action, guerrilla messaging, propaganda, subvertising, decoration and territory claiming. The following is a small window into this temporary world that's constantly being revised in a flux of new symbols. It's a snapshot of work on the Seattle streets, a visual capsule in time, not a comprehensive representation of Seattle street art and the people involved over the years. Some of the work only existed for a day before it was written over by other artists or removed by the city... a reminder that nothing is permanent and, control is an illusion in the chaos of a city.

250624,16050963,"Moby Dick: or, the White Whale",eng,"This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B004TRXX7C.
Moby-Dick; or, The Whale, was written by American author Herman Melville and first published in 1851. It is considered to be one of the Great American Novels and a treasure of world literature. The story tells the adventures of wandering sailor Ishmael, and his voyage on the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ishmael soon learns that Ahab has one purpose on this voyage: to seek out a specific whale--Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white sperm whale. In a previous encounter, the whale destroyed Ahab's boat and bit off his leg, which now drives Ahab to take revenge.
In Moby-Dick, Melville employs stylized language, symbolism, and metaphor to explore numerous complex themes. Through the main character's journey, the concepts of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God are all examined, as Ishmael speculates upon his personal beliefs and his place in the universe. The narrator's reflections, along with his descriptions of a sailor's life aboard a whaling ship, are woven into the narrative along with Shakespearean literary devices, such as stage directions, extended soliloquies, and asides. The book portrays destructive obsession and monomania, as well as the assumption of anthropomorphism--projecting human instincts, characteristics and motivations onto animals. Moby Dick is ruthless in attacking the sailors who attempt to hunt and kill him, but it is Ahab who invests Moby Dick's natural instincts with malignant and evil intentions. In fact, it is not the whale but the crippled Ahab who alone possesses this characteristic.
Moby-Dick has been classified as American Romanticism. It was first published by Richard Bentley in London on October 18, 1851, in an expurgated three-volume edition titled The Whale, and weeks later as a single volume, by New York City publisher Harper and Brothers as Moby-Dick; or, The Whale on November 14, 1851. The book initially received mixed reviews, but Moby-Dick is now considered part of the Western canon, and at the center of the canon of American novels.

But Amanda has some demons of her own to exorcise, and her delight in subjugating Ed is mixed with doubts and uncertainties. Does she really want to be a dominatrix at all, or would she rather bottom for her old public school friend and right-wing extremist Shona, and her leatherdyke motorcycle gang?
As Amanda introduces Ed to pegging, enforced chastity and transatlantic teasing and denial, he is drawn into a complex geometry of sexual jealousy, abduction and dodgy independent film-making, where nothing is quite what it seems.",[],15.0,104.0,5.0,3.35,0.07126072338933917,0.06541642317325855,0.07166580280559151,0.06862011537878476,1.0,1.0,0.07008951200560724,0.05690101845071026,1.0,0.06738368827741432,0.06203142511083405,1.0,0.03980211390935676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
490500,10437231,"The Fallen Blade (The Assassini, #1)",en-US,"Venice in the early fifteenth century is at the height of its power. In theory Duke Marco commands. But Marco is a simpleton so his aunt and uncle rule in his stead. Within the Serene Republic, their word is law, but for all their influence, Venice's fate still lies in other hands . . .
Lady Giulietta is the Duke's cousin. She enjoys greater privilege than many can even dream of, but her status will demand a terrible price.
Atilo Il Mauros is head of the Assassini, the shadow army that enforces Venice's will - both at home and abroad.
Prince Leopold zum Bas Friedland is the bastard son of the German emperor and leader of the krieghund- the only force in Venice more feared than Atilo's assassins.
And then there is Atilo's angel-faced apprentice. Only a boy, Tycho is already stronger and faster than any man has a right to be. He can see in the dark, but sunlight burns him. It is said that he drinks blood.
Award-winning author Jon Courtenay Grimwood seamlessly blends history, politics and dark fantasy in a compelling vision of a Venice that might have been.","['7786771', '8087828', '8698731', '13227027', '43684', '8140709', '10353283', '8241571', '9737151', '6951425', '11515333', '3567035', '276485', '874977', '16158784', '11339115', '16059435', '2822861']",38.0,454.0,4.0,3.24,1.0,1.0,0.062285212156121594,0.05724602642068262,0.07648451465304773,0.06559589905627077,1.0,1.0,0.07271070605269375,0.04987242845959477,0.06678707502123499,0.06507497294921022,0.06665641951759677,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

These last it will surely drive to the text &, as surely, will drive them to approach it in a truly philosophical spirit. Bennett's Kant isn't a giant immersed, or frozen, in time. He's a great contemporary-a little out of touch, admittedly, with recent developments in mathematics & physics-but one with whom we can all argue, against him, at his side, or obliquely to him. So Bennett does argue, continuously, fiercely & fruitfully; & summons to join in the argument, at appropriate moments, those older contemporaries, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley & Hume, & those younger contemporaries, Wittgenstein, Ryle, Ayler, Quine, Quinton, Warnock etc. This is splendid, & a necessary corrective to that extraordinary isolation in which Kant tends to be islanded, partly indeed, by his own unique qualities, but partly by oceans of the wrong kind of respect.

Insomnia has claimed everyone Biggs knows. Even his beloved wife, Carolyn, has succumbed to the telltale red-rimmed eyes, slurred speech and cloudy mind before disappearing into the quickly collapsing world. Yet Biggs can still sleep, and dream, so he sets out to find her.
He ventures out into a world ransacked by mass confusion and desperation, where he meets others struggling against the tide of sleeplessness. Chase and his buddy Jordan are devising a scheme to live off their drug-store lootings; Lila is a high school student wandering the streets in an owl mask, no longer safe with her insomniac parents; Felicia abandons the sanctuary of a sleep research center to try to protect her family and perhaps reunite with Chase, an ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, Biggs persists in his quest for Carolyn, finding a resolve and inner strength that he never knew he had.
Kenneth Calhoun has written a brilliant evocation of how personal connection can keep us grounded in the face of chaos. Black Moonis devastatingly vivid, hypnotically strange, and profoundly moving.","['17934640', '17995421', '17256056', '29487446', '24694081', '25527267', '17910155', '18114114', '22543706', '17910115', '17452206', '18210950', '26067164', '7036077', '20578712', '7980199', '20483103', '23705513']",111.0,288.0,8.0,3.16,1.0,0.09698771798240884,0.08545804960598667,0.0829652091857889,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.07320469653082118,0.0875553822457904,0.08444279963637291,0.08370805476446329,0.09193014053232008,0.06357911161255417,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In her celebrated memoirs of life in Tuscany, Frances Mayes writes masterfully about people in a powerful and shaping place. In Swan, her first novel, she has created an equally intimate world, rich with striking characters and intriguing twists of fate, that hearkens back to her southern roots.
The Masons are a prominent but now fragmented family who have lived for generations in Swan, an edenic, hidebound small town in Georgia. As Swan opens, a bizarre crime pulls Ginger Mason home from her life as an archeologist in Italy: The body of her mother, Catherine, a suicide nineteen years before, has been mysteriously exhumed. Reunited on new terms with her troubled, isolated brother J.J., who has never ventured far from Swan, the Mason children grapple with the profound effects of their mother's life and death on their own lives. When a new explanation for Catherine's death emerges, and other closely guarded family secrets rise to the surface as well, Ginger and J.J. are confronted with startling truths about their family, a particular ordeal in a family and a town that wants to keep the past buried.
Beautifully evoking the rhythms and idiosyncrasies of the deep South while telling an utterly compelling story of the complexity of family ties, Swanmarks the remarkable fiction debut of one of America's best-loved writers.","['366214', '492259', '2219523', '3920', '783161', '240418', '384215', '6549284', '199636', '21230', '942792', '48790', '6604809', '11641558', '2093091', '527077']",534.0,336.0,70.0,3.24,0.21349314973866074,0.211191219973186,0.21287871657882879,0.22059717799051684,1.0,1.0,0.2307956355492171,0.21018378089279594,0.22998460297382692,0.1836029056627889,1.0,1.0,0.14021756593581425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

It examines the historical ideological and local roots of terrorist violence, and the success of specific terrorist and anti-terrorist campaigns in the more distant as well as the recent past.","['349776', '1358350', '784149', '100018', '3306986', '176904', '784164', '9836706', '74639', '6905410', '751458', '2366247', '784150', '74648', '595616', '595615', '74649', '74652']",135.0,144.0,19.0,3.26,1.0,0.05470260259350157,1.0,0.04817441339582782,0.04742945901857786,0.03058094414335641,0.03653617089390175,1.0,0.035767730720485204,0.0272501935457458,0.037019229559204496,0.03254890671794474,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

448575,13069299,America the Philosophical,eng,"A bold, insightful book that rejects the myth of America the Unphilosophical, arguing that America today towers as the most philosophical culture in the history of the world, an unprecedented marketplace of truth and argument that far surpasses ancient Greece or any other place one can name.
With verve and keen intelligence, Carlin Romano--Pulitzer Prize finalist, award-winning book critic, and professor of philosophy--takes on the widely held belief that ours is an anti-intellectual society.
Instead, while providing a richly reported overview of American thought, Romano argues that ordinary Americans see through phony philosophical justifications faster than anyone else, and that the best of our thinkers abandon artificial academic debates for fresh intellectual enterprises, such as cyber-philosophy. Along the way, Romano seeks to topple philosophy's most fiercely admired hero, Socrates, asserting that it is Isocrates, the nearly forgotten Greek philosopher who rejected certainty, whom Americans should honor as their intellectual ancestor.
America the Philosophicalintroduces readers to a nation whose existence most still doubt: a dynamic, deeply stimulating network of people and places drawn together by shared excitement about ideas. From the annual conference of the American Philosophical Association, where scholars tack wiseguy notes addressed to Spinoza on a public bulletin board, to the eruption of philosophy blogs where participants discuss everything from pedagogy to the philosophy of science to the nature of agency and free will, Romano reveals a world where public debate and intellectual engagement never stop.
Readers meet the men and women whose ideas have helped shape American life over the previous few centuries, from well-known historical figures like William James and Ralph Waldo Emerson, to modern cultural critics who deserve to be seen as thinkers (Kenneth Burke, Edward Said), to the iconoclastic African American, women, Native American, and gay mavericks (Cornel West, Susan Sontag, Anne Waters, Richard Mohr) who have broadened the boundaries of American philosophy.
Smart and provocative, America the Philosophicalis a rebellious tour de force that both celebrates our country's unparalleled intellectual energy and promises to bury some of our most hidebound cultural cliches.","['11308015', '418702', '15897043', '704824', '5936134', '301050', '250941', '263913', '479533', '159562', '31875', '924075', '191294', '2430265', '10144239']",60.0,688.0,17.0,3.4,0.10824212712314127,1.0,0.08834285460999072,1.0,1.0,0.08357312794549018,0.09677291462506456,1.0,0.08720121884871809,0.09031116689340285,0.0892695815423188,0.10670144633814525,0.1087390744733428,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Summer, 2002. Single, carefree Montreal waitress Sara meets an intriguing out-of-towner whom she calls B-- in her quirky private journal. They hang out. They get close. He's like no one she's ever met. In fact... there's something very strange about him, almost as though he's psychic. She probes deeper. He finally opens up to her: he's a genetic oddity with an extra sense acquired through a twist of evolutionary fate. Although initially skeptical, she soon falls in love with him and starts to believe his story.
Shortly after Sara unexpectedly becomes pregnant, B-- reveals that a former friend is pressuring him to undergo genetic testing at a pseudo-governmental research lab outside Chicago. B-- is tempted to go there. What if there are others like him? Could their unborn child have the same ""new sense""?
Suddenly, B-- disappears without a trace. Sara puts her journal online as a blog in the desperate hope that someone, somewhere can help her find him. As her pregnancy progresses and the days turn into weeks, she is forced to ask herself if anything she knows about him is really true, and whether their son will ever know his father. Realizing that the lab's shady operatives are now following her every move, Sara begins to fear for her own safety. The suspense mounts as she wonders: is it me they're after... or my baby?

I have this painting I did a few years ago that I'd love to see where an author could take it. The set up is:
The magician's apprentice risked a dangerous spell to rescue the arrogant prince with whom he's fallen in love. The prince realizes his own feelings have changed from animosity to love; this after a series of confrontations that didn't bode well for a relationship. By the looks of it though, the HEA afterglow is blissful.
Photo Description:An impressionistic painting of two naked men in a tight standing embrace. One, bulkier and paler with hair that appears gray, holds the other man almost off the ground, hands tight on his ass. The other man wraps his arms around his lover's shoulder's. His skin has a tracery of dark lines and he appears to have dark-feathered wings.
This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's ""Hot Summer Days""event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.

Two crimes of passion separated by 140 years but bound by strange similarities. In 2013, Tara's little sister, Pia, a young aspiring novelist, is investigating the curious story of Margaret, one of the first known 'victims' of the Stockholm Syndrome. When Pia stumbles upon Margaret's private journal and letters, she finally begins to understand how it might have been possible for that woman to fall in love with her captor. But the more compelling question before Pia is whether her sister might have been similarly in love. Why else had she not returned home when she clearly had the chance? But, if she had been in love, why was she eventually killed?

442304,25350104,Muse,eng,"A sparkling fiction debut from the poet, translator, and FSG publisher that tells the story of the decades-long rivalry between two publishing lions over the work of an iconic female poet.
Paul Dukach is heir apparent at Purcell & Stern, one of the last independent publishing houses in New York, whose shabby offices on Union Square belie the treasures of its list. Thanks to his boss, the flamboyant Homer Stern, Paul learns well the ins and outs of the book world: how to work an agent over lunch and swim with the literary sharks at Frankfurt; how to marry flattery with criticism when combing over the manuscripts of brilliant, volatile authors. But though things can be shaky in the age of conglomerates and digital, Paul remains obsessed by one dazzling writer: poet Ida Perkins, whose outsize life and audacious verse have shaped America's contemporary literary landscape, and whose longtime publisher--also her cousin and erstwhile lover--happens to be Homer's biggest rival. When Paul at last meets Ida at her secluded Venetian palazzo, she entrusts him with her greatest secret--one that will change all of their lives forever. Enriched by juicy details only a quintessential insider could know, written with both satiric sharpness and sensitivity, Museis a hilarious and touching love letter to the people who write, sell--and, above all, read--the books that shape our lives.","['18490539', '11818125', '16130059', '22929495', '23562898', '17173273', '763027', '1282880', '818871', '23847953', '25987136', '23492774', '23213831', '17905468', '22320471', '53079', '20893614', '23308445']",9.0,258.0,5.0,2.8,0.14735201084135177,0.1439887444913628,0.14362050541256233,1.0,1.0,0.14412157157429042,1.0,0.1474065450951472,0.13149360950519318,0.1347377776106888,0.13782803038941072,1.0,0.10311256484855424,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

119913,15841856,Yellowcake,en-US,"Yellowcakebrings together ten short stories from the extraordinarily talented Margo Lanagan--each of them fiercely original and quietly heartbreaking.
The stories range from fantasy and fairy tale to horror and stark reality, and yet what pervades is the sense of humanity. The people of Lanagan's worlds face trials, temptations, and degradations. They swoon and suffer and even kill for love. In a dangerous world, they seek the solace and strength that comes from family and belonging.
These are stories to be savored slowly and pondered deeply because they cut to the very heart of who we are.

539084,6650740,The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050,en-US,"Visionary social thinker Joel Kotkin looks ahead to America in 2050, revealing how the addition of one hundred million Americans by midcentury will transform how we all live, work, and prosper. 
In stark contrast to the rest of the world's advanced nations, the United States is growing at a record rate and, according to census projections, will be home to four hundred million Americans by 2050. This projected rise in population is the strongest indicator of our long-term economic strength, Joel Kotkin believes, and will make us more diverse and more competitive than any nation on earth.
Drawing on prodigious research, firsthand reportage, and historical analysis, The Next Hundred Millionreveals how this unprecedented growth will take physical shape and change the face of America. The majority of the additional hundred million Americans will find their homes in suburbia, though the suburbs of tomorrow will not resemble the Levittowns of the 1950s or the sprawling exurbs of the late twentieth century. The suburbs of the twenty-first century will be less reliant on major cities for jobs and other amenities and, as a result, more energy efficient. Suburbs will also be the melting pots of the future as more and more immigrants opt for dispersed living over crowded inner cities and the majority in the United States becomes nonwhite by 2050.
In coming decades, urbanites will flock in far greater numbers to affordable, vast, and autoreliant metropolitan areas-such as Houston, Phoenix, and Las Vegas-than to glamorous but expensive industrial cities, such as New York and Chicago. Kotkin also foresees that the twenty-first century will be marked by a resurgence of the American heartland, far less isolated in the digital era and a crucial source of renewable fuels and real estate for a growing population. But in both big cities and small towns across the country, we will see what Kotkin calls ""the new localism""-a greater emphasis on family ties and local community, enabled by online networks and the increasing numbers of Americans working from home.
The Next Hundred Millionprovides a vivid snapshot of America in 2050 by focusing not on power brokers, policy disputes, or abstract trends, but rather on the evolution of the more intimate units of American society-families, towns, neighborhoods, industries. It is upon the success or failure of these communities, Kotkin argues, that the American future rests.","['8780329', '3343327', '2897333', '8717667', '6775123', '17131775', '972311', '7980425', '8254616', '6349905', '8125846', '13259699', '9697369', '12476978', '946222', '8180852', '11956229']",151.0,320.0,36.0,3.17,1.0,0.1237334423789832,0.11299455558907967,1.0,1.0,0.12761388408105664,0.1114165582182728,1.0,0.11483767070412527,0.10821400260744111,0.10631688313471609,0.11681053670307955,0.0972667546237219,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Now, hospital dietitian Lisa Johansen makes the bold case that the fast food industry is actually a positive force in society. Johansen takes the reader from the industry's scrappy, entrepreneurial beginnings to its emergence as a global business generating hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Far from a blight on society, the fast food industry has distinguished itself by providing a product that meets high standards of quality and safety, often healthier than meals served at home and in sit-down restaurants. The myth of the ""McJob"" is debunked by true-life cases of corporate titans who succeeded by virtue of the fast-food chains' practice of promoting from within. And, relying on her years of counseling patients at one of the nation's largest health networks, Johansen shows the reader just how easily fast food can be incorporated into a healthy lifestyle.

A beautiful, feminine-looking young man faces the camera with a slight smile on his face. He has feather clips on the lashes of both eyes, which are also heavily lined with mascara. Studs in his lips, upswept blond hair, and an utterly peaceful aura complete his look. He seems like he's not afraid of what he likes, and he is willing to let people see that side of him, that openness of his quirks and what he enjoys, without feeling guilty.

Do you feel that it would be advantageous to understand what your ""significant other"" is thinking? There have been numerous books written by authors such as John Gray, Neil Strauss, Sherry Argov, and Steve Harvey, about the differences between men and women in relationships, however, the romantic comedy ""Why Men are from Earth and Women Are Not From Venus; A Romantic Comedy for Understanding the Alpha Male"" gives a fresh perspective into the inner workings of the modern relationship. Filled with hilarious real-life scenarios, this indispensable relationship guide lets women see inside the alpha male mind set.
Women will no longer have to turn to their female friends to ask what their alpha male partner is thinking (which, if you think about it, is probably not the best strategy), and men can have a good laugh at the expense of the author as he details all of the ""mistakes"" he has made in the personal relationship with his wife.
Full of advice, important topics such as:
-Sex,
-Commitment,
-Honesty,
-Money, and
-Effective Communication
are discussed in a humours manner that is engaging for any man or women who wants to understand how the alpha male thinks when it comes to relationships, intimacy, romance, and love.

541322,17018508,My Dear Watson,en-US,"One of the most famous partnerships in literature yields, over time, to a peculiar romantic triangle. Sherlock Holmes. Dr. John Watson. And the good doctor's second wife, whom Doyle never named. In L A Fields's novel, Mrs. Watson is a clever woman who realizes, through examining all the prior cases her husband shared with the world's greatest consulting detective, that the two men shared more than adventures: they were lovers, as well. In 1919, after the pair has retired, Mrs. Watson invites Holmes to her home to meet him face to face. Thus begins a recounting of a peculiar affair between extraordinary men.
""You are such a unique person,"" Holmes says poisonously. ""What a shame that history will most likely never remember your name.""
The question Mrs. Watson faces: Did Holmes simply take advantage of her husband's loyalty and love, or did the detective return those feelings? And what to do now that the pair are no longer living together at Baker Street and Watson has other claims on his affections? My Dear Watson offers readers a romance that requires as much reasoning to puzzle out as it does passion. Mrs. Watson proves a worthy opponent--in intellect, in guile, in conviction--for the great detective.

Nazneen knows not a word of English, and is forced to depend on her husband. But unlike him she is practical and wise, and befriends a fellow Asian girl Razia, who helps her understand the strange ways of her adopted new British home.

The computer-centered method of getting from the author's conception to completed print-or electronic-book has come to dominate publishing, involving not only the setting of type but also the preparation of manuscripts, editing, illustration creation and processing, page makeup, color separation, and preparation for printing. Even more significant than its use for these individual procedures is the computer's role in creating an integrated system that is greater than the sum of its parts.
Covering all the publishing processes up to distribution, Bookmakingaddresses the needs of publishing professionals, whether they do the work themselves in-house or have it done to their specifications by outside suppliers.

It includes explanations of criminal behavior and criminality, including the role of mental disorder in crime, and it reveals how forensic psychology contributes to helping investigate the crime and catching the perpetrators. David Canter also explains how psychologists provide guidance to all those involved in civil and criminal court proceedings, including both the police and the accused, and what expert testimony can be provided by a psychologist about the offender at the trial. Finally, Canter describes how forensic psychology is used, particularly in prisons, to help in the management, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders, once they have been convicted.","['12217871', '7698899', '132908', '74637', '287847', '74653', '5115533', '74648', '11968513', '3206523', '3306986', '1406842', '2912446', '225550', '74660', '5997807', '8151688']",160.0,145.0,12.0,3.4,1.0,0.03261039734804502,1.0,0.03929962122246646,0.04323041500544684,0.025263716896013325,0.02702760716838902,0.02960314575613345,1.0,0.02211256022986048,1.0,0.026966409371614476,0.01966597434118324,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Kevern doesn't know why his father always drew two fingers across his lips when he said a world starting with a J. It wasn't then, and isn't now, the time or place to be asking questions. Ailinn too has grown up in the dark about who she was or where she came from. On their first date Kevern kisses the bruises under her eyes. He doesn't ask who hurt her. Brutality has grown commonplace. They aren't sure if they have fallen in love of their own accord, or whether they've been pushed into each other's arms. But who would have pushed them, and why?
Hanging over the lives of all the characters in this novel is a momentous catastrophe - a past event shrouded in suspicion, denial and apology, now referred to as What Happened, If It Happened.

As the conspiracy to halt the Enlightenment's astonishing progress intensifies, young Dalessius's courage--as well as Voltaire's unique cunning and wit--are put to the ultimate test as they strive to ensure the survival of the future.","['6072232', '8588957', '8547207', '10320885', '10175072', '9280057', '102137', '10176352', '2321054', '6665902', '440329', '7207765', '8089555', '8087046', '6881498', '8049140', '7456030', '9721966']",246.0,160.0,48.0,2.98,0.13678460058780842,0.12811930799705282,0.12016932196226628,0.10964409782708041,1.0,0.11104761578147557,1.0,0.11471067322141246,1.0,0.08820321510237175,1.0,0.12958576631378088,0.09031324706060186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Port Royal, Jamaica's capital, a cut-throat town of taverns, grog shops, and bawdy houses, is devoid of London's luxuries; life here can end swiftly with dysentery or a dagger in your back. But for Captain Charles Hunter it is a life that can also lead to riches, if he abides by the island's code. In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take it into their hands.
Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor awaiting repairs. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish outpost is guarded by the blood-swiller Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip IV himself. With the governor's backing, Hunter assembles a roughneck crew to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon, along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of Matanceros suggest, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds himself on the island's shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure.
With the help of his cunning crew, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake.

401306,7489522,Alexander in Babylon,eng,"Wassermann, a German Jew, wrote Alexander in Babylon in 1905. An English edition came out 44 years later. It's similar to Butts, Berkovici & Mann in style. Like Butts, it's a highly poetic, romantic novel, full of symbolism. F.i., after Hephaistion's death, when a troubled Alexander has gone off by himself, he takes a wild night ride across a Persian prarie, his horse out of control. He's finally able to bring the beast back to camp where ""it gave vent to a heartbreaking cry. Then it collapsed. A huge scorpion clung to its flank."" This is a significant turning point. The book is full of similar moments. Some work better than others, but overall, the effect is to pull readers into a dreamlike world intersecting history & myth. Like other early romantic-influenced writers, he's less concerned with history than with meaning. In the same vein as Plutarch centuries earlier, Alexander in Babylon is a moral tale, about power & the corruption of power, fate & trust. We're given the last 18 months of the life of a confused world conqueror. Hephaistion is the devoted friend who discovers the man to whom he originally committed himself no longer exists, &, learning this, loses his will to live. There's Arrhidaios, the unlucky brother who lives in Alexander's shadow & has lost the ability to know dreams from reality. Finally, there's the priestess-witch Liblitu, a fictional figure serving a symbolic function.
Historically speaking, much is wrong. Wassermann conveniently collapses events. It begins in the Gedrosian desert disaster & goes from there. Hephaistion dies not at Ekbatana, but at Opus. Alexander then takes off by himself for a while until a sign (the scorpion) convinces him to go to Babylon, where things close with the mortal end of he who thought himself a god.

The Wakefields seem to have everything. Garrison is a hugely successful graphic artist. Liza is an active member of the community and a patron of the arts. Their 16-year-old daughter Angel is bright, beautiful, and a gifted dancer. At the same time, though, they have traded away many of their dreams. Garrison gave up a future as an accomplished painter to make money. Liza suspended her own dancing career to raise a family. And Angel is setting aside her ambitions to live her mother's dream.
When Angel gets into a car accident that kills her first love, the Wakefields' lives turn on a dime. While Angel lies in a coma from which even the best prognosis is devastating, Garrison and Liza sit by her side, their once-passionate marriage in tatters. As their heartache over Angel builds, Garrison and Liza struggle to rediscover who they once were--and who they were meant to be. They come to realize that it will take everything they have within themselves to heal Angel, heal their hearts, and renew the power of their love.

New York. 2120. American has been decimated, wiped out from the second Civil War. In this post-apocalyptic world, survivors are far and few between. And most of those who do survive are members of the violent gangs, predators who live in the big cities. They patrol the countryside looking for slaves, for fresh victims to bring back into the city for their favorite death sport: Arena One. The death stadium where opponents are made to fight to the death, in the most barbaric of ways. There is only one rule to the arena: no one survives. Ever.
Deep in the wilderness, high up in the Catskill Mountains, 17 year old Brooke Moore manages to survive, hiding out with her younger sister, Bree. They are careful to avoid the gangs of slaverunners who patrol the countryside. But one day, Brooke is not as careful as she can be, and Bree is captured. The slaverunners take her away, heading to the city, and to what will be a certain death.
Brooke, a Marine's daughter, was raised to be tough, to never back down from a fight. When her sister is taken, Brooke mobilizes, uses everything at her disposal to chase down the slaverunners and get her sister back. Along the way she runs into Ben, 17, another survivor like her, whose brother was taken. Together, they team up on their rescue mission.
What follows is a post-apocalyptic, action-packed thriller, as the two of them pursue the slaverunners on the most dangerous ride of their lives, following them deep into the heart of New York. Along the way, if they are to survive, they will have to make some of the hardest choices and sacrifices of their lives, encountering obstacles neither of them had expected--including their unexpected feelings for each other. Will they rescue their siblings? Will they make it back? And will they, themselves, have to fight in the arena?

To date, the new chair has garnered mixed reviews. Business economists see him as the best-qualified successor to Greenspan, while many traders and investors worry that he's too academic for the job. Meanwhile, many ordinary Americans do not even know who he is.
How will Bernanke's leadership affect the Fed's actions in the coming years? How will Bernanke build on Greenspan's success, but also put his own stamp on the Fed? What will all this imply for businesses and investors? In Ben Bernanke's Fed, Ethan Harris provides exceptional insights into these crucial issues.
As a leading ""Fed watch"" economist, Harris draws on Bernanke's academic research, his speeches as a governor of the Fed, and his first two years on the job to shed light on:
* How the Federal Reserve analyzes and manages the economy using a synthesis of classical and Keynesian theory
* Bernanke's strategies for fighting inflation
* The implications of the new chair's remarkably plain-spoken style
* How Bernanke has cultivated diverse viewpoints but still builds consensus within the Fed

As a result, the largest remaining threat to his health is now his junior colleague's reckless driving.

398102,19139644,Learning Python Design Patterns,eng,"Design pattern is a well-known approach to solve some specific problems which each software developer comes across during his work. Design patterns capture higher-level constructs that commonly appear in programs. If you know how to implement the design pattern in one language, typically you will be able to port and use it in another object-oriented programming language.
The choice of implementation language affects the use of design patterns. Naturally, some languages are more applicable for certain tasks than others. Each language has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. In this book, we introduce some of the better known design patterns in Python. You will learn when and how to use the design patterns, and implement a real-world example which you can run and examine by yourself.
You will start with one of the most popular software architecture patterns which is the Model- View-Controller pattern. Then you will move on to learn about two creational design patterns which are Singleton and Factory, and two structural patterns which are Facade and Proxy. Finally, the book also explains three behavioural patterns which are Command, Observer, and Template.
Approach This book takes a tutorial-based and user-friendly approach to covering Python design patterns. Its concise presentation means that in a short space of time, you will get a good introduction to various design patterns.
Who this book is for If you are an intermediate level Python user, this book is for you. Prior knowledge of Python programming is essential. Some knowledge of UML is also required to understand the UML diagrams which are used to describe some design patterns.",[],19.0,100.0,7.0,3.36,1.0,1.0,0.05705385506152367,0.057599627321372665,0.06221887686724214,1.0,1.0,0.05369873077746654,0.05405529824946217,0.04779345749705877,0.05268301070249134,0.05961246899321759,0.04368062802096449,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The gripping debut thriller featuring attorney-turnedfishing- guide Jake Trent, whose idyllic life is upended by a series of grisly killings. 
Early summer in Jackson, Wyoming, finds former East Coast prosecutor Jake Trent wading through a swift current of local politics, introspection, and tragedy.
After leaving law behind, Jake escaped big-city life to pursue his dream: setting up as a fishing guide and opening a small bed-and-breakfast in the West. Now three seemingly unrelated deaths have occurred in one day--unheard of in the scenic valley of Jackson Hole--disrupting Jake's contented new life.
A skier perishes in a freak late-season avalanche. A French couple is discovered mutilated--presumably by a bear--on a remote trail in Grand Teton National Park. On the Snake River, Jake himself finds the body of an expensively attired tourist fisherman. Meanwhile, a series of small earthquakes--not to mention a bitter dispute between land developers and a cultlike group of environmentalists--has left the townspeople uneasy.
Before long, the plausible explanations for each death dissolve. Could there be a sinister connection among them? When fresh evidence points to him as a suspect, Jake Trent is put on the defensive. Is someone out to frame him? Can Jake keep the demons from his past at bay while he tries to discover the truth behind the mysterious deaths?
Defying the police, Jake teams up with beautiful park ranger Noelle Klimpton to get to the bottom of this series of disturbing events. The trail leads right to the region's crown-jewel attraction: Yellowstone. What they discover will put both their lives at risk. . . .
Death Canyonmarks the debut of David Riley Bertsch, a major new talent in suspense fiction.","['17262759', '16130314', '18127874', '704332', '17593767', '17871430', '18090379', '18921757', '17262459', '18339836', '16130485', '16071858', '17562997', '18468594']",114.0,373.0,32.0,3.09,1.0,0.1666596616689207,1.0,0.14993002222048646,1.0,0.1602188053771383,0.17059968794075112,0.1478279866815997,0.1812428191043327,0.13410837759997923,1.0,0.17986654286899734,0.10514308532384516,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

252258,16091192,Canada,en-GB,"""First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.""
When fifteen-year-old Dell Parsons' parents rob a bank, his sense of normal life is forever altered. In an instant, this private cataclysm drives his life into before and after, a threshold that can never be uncrossed.
His parents' arrest and imprisonment mean a threatening and uncertain future for Dell and his twin sister, Berner. Willful and burning with resentment, Berner flees their home in Montana, abandoning her brother and her life. But Dell is not completely alone. A family friend intervenes, spiriting him across the Canadian border, in hopes of delivering him to a better life. There, afloat on the prairie of Saskatchewan, Dell is taken in by Arthur Remlinger, an enigmatic and charismatic American whose cool reserve masks a dark and violent nature.
Undone by the calamity of his parents' robbery and arrest, Dell struggles under the vast prairie sky to remake himself and define the adults he thought he knew. But his search for grace and peace only moves him nearer to a harrowing and murderous collision with Remlinger, an elemental force of darkness.
A true masterwork of haunting and spectacular vision from one of our greatest writers, Canada is a profound novel of boundaries traversed, innocence lost and reconciled, and the mysterious and consoling bonds of family. Told in spare, elegant prose, both resonant and luminous, it is destined to become a classic.","['11076138', '13589156', '12510833', '13414604', '13513073', '11797352', '11159242', '9031389', '13366259', '13325079', '13722902', '15762186', '10277268', '14569046', '10756240', '13030260', '12468712', '15717846']",30.0,420.0,6.0,3.49,0.13511451517076245,0.1345805187678746,0.14831556697882423,0.12748159224359235,1.0,1.0,0.13664093508045677,0.12454068731264735,0.14204031537338782,0.10533341059456806,1.0,1.0,0.08583608063751295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
528677,8584832,Mr. Shakespeare's Bastard,eng,"In a quiet manor house in Oxfordshire, an ailing housekeeper by the name of Aerlene Ward feels the time has come to confess the great secret that has shaped her life-she is the illegitimate daughter of William Shakespeare, England's most famous playwright.
With a brilliant eye and ear for this rich period of history, Richard B. Wright brings to life the teeming streets of Elizabethan London and the seasonal rhythms of rural life in Oliver Cromwell's England as he interweaves the intriguing stories of the lovely Elizabeth, who allows herself to be seduced by a struggling young writer from Stratford, and her plain but clever daughter, who must live with the consequences.
As their lives unfold, secrets are revealed, love is found and lost, and futures are forever changed. Readers will be fascinated by glimpses of the young Will as an actor with the Queen's Men and, fifteen years later, as a world-weary but increasingly wealthy playwright -- who may have had an unexpected daughter.
An engaging blend of invention and historical detail, and echoing the unmistakable style of the Bard himself, Mr. Shakespeare's Bastardconfirms Wright as one of our finest storytellers. This unforgettable novel will delight the senses and touch the heart.","['6539583', '2114065', '13414750', '6396579', '14743204', '6439984', '15724667', '6098580', '2322130', '34068494', '13101445', '2686934', '9970166', '3345434', '16169861', '17262157', '8548164', '17831488']",365.0,342.0,68.0,3.36,0.17812190730994826,0.18782284163849974,0.1756770155696788,0.18612956754215573,1.0,0.19200108727629597,1.0,1.0,0.17183565830412734,0.16864328498531672,0.1911749078483883,1.0,0.1411763660412021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Now the man has the gall to show up and suggest she become the next Titania? She'd rather wipe that charming grin off his face with a pot of hot java to the groin.

Starting off at a slower, fairytale pace, the story shifts, killing the sweetness without looking back, and jettisons the reader into a world of chaos and calm, loyalty and adversity, redemption and long lost love.
Blood Life is a vampire/witch thriller full of blood, magic, love, violence, and sex. It is no Twilight or Vampire Diaries! It's much darker and sexier, but equally as engrossing and unique. The witches and vampires of the fictional world of the Spectrum have united and created a race of half-breeds called the Combined. These are very powerful entities, but their race has been threatened by a rogue vampire with very old, powerful blood named Lokee, the son of the Great Witch, Devendra. This story is about letting Fate play out, but in all its turmoil, trying to save one woman who will be the key to saving the witches, the vampires, AND the Combined. Of course, the villain is very much against all that, and tortures her time and again to try to destroy her.
Can the Combined's strongest vampire adversary form an army to defeat them, or will the power of three keep the race on top? Centered around the lives of four integral characters, Blood Life is an adventure series unlike any in the genre. Meet Devendra, a powerful witch descended from one of the first lineages; Lokee, her son and worst enemy; Roman, her friend and companion; and Alethea, the key to it all...","['13637157', '15989083', '12707393', '12717966', '10166240', '11053921', '13495785', '18500819', '25068473', '16119167', '12945682', '11161444', '9972389', '7878966', '17403320', '22054176', '11374039', '13158635']",54.0,326.0,21.0,3.43,0.23620470252429962,0.25270237214978153,0.19622764544051197,0.21230261363380293,1.0,0.2367838080664435,1.0,0.2355861883348025,1.0,0.18096897108096927,0.19824684191312789,1.0,0.17659724242743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

154598,10365343,Zone One,eng,"In this wry take on the post-apocalyptic horror novel, a pandemic has devastated the planet. The plague has sorted humanity into two types: the uninfected and the infected, the living and the living dead.
Now the plague is receding, and Americans are busy rebuilding civilization under orders from the provisional government based in Buffalo. Their top mission: the resettlement of Manhattan. Armed forces have successfully reclaimed the island south of Canal Street--aka Zone One--but pockets of plague-ridden squatters remain. While the army has eliminated the most dangerous of the infected, teams of civilian volunteers are tasked with clearing out a more innocuous variety--the ""malfunctioning"" stragglers, who exist in a catatonic state, transfixed by their former lives.
Mark Spitz is a member of one of the civilian teams working in lower Manhattan. Alternating between flashbacks of Spitz's desperate fight for survival during the worst of the outbreak and his present narrative, the novel unfolds over three surreal days, as it depicts the mundane mission of straggler removal, the rigors of Post-Apocalyptic Stress Disorder, and the impossible job of coming to grips with the fallen world.
And then things start to go wrong.

And we must take the current when it serves
Or lose our ventures.
In a future, long-declining America, society is strictly stratified by class. Long-abandoned urban neighborhoods have been repurposed as highwalled, self-contained labor colonies. And the members of the labor class -- descendants of those brought over en masse many years earlier from environmentally ruined provincial China -- find purpose and identity in their work to provide pristine produce and fish to the small, elite, satellite charter villages that ring the labor settlement.
In this world lives Fan, a female fish-tank diver, who leaves her home in the B-Mor settlement (once known as Baltimore), when the man she loves mysteriously disappears. Fan's journey to find him takes her out of the safety of B-Mor, through the anarchic Open Counties, where crime is rampant with scant governmental oversight, and to a faraway charter village, in a quest that will soon become legend to those she left behind.

When commercial artist Richard Sifkitz finally gets around to having that physical he'd been putting off for years, and his cholesterol comes back dangerously high, he does what so many thirty-something, junk food-eating couch potatoes have done before him: he buys a stationary bike, and vows to ride it regularly. 
Unlike many a mid-life exercise convert, however, Richard actually starts to ride his new stationary bike. A lot. Soon he's spending so much time on his bike that he decides to put his artistic talents to use and paint a mural on the wall opposite his stationary bike. But it turns out that Richard's mural is no ordinary picture -- and soon his stationary bike is taking him places he doesn't want to go...and can't stay away from. 
A riveting riff on artistic frustration, midlife mortality, and hard-won redemption, Stationary Bikeis a thrill ride that could come only from the mind of Stephen King.","['11532', '66370', '3547311', '32701', '32663', '155426', '1011193', '906622', '454030', '383137', '6980553', '182542', '10612', '745796', '15776356', '490136', '22337']",2384.0,44.0,137.0,3.46,0.0588097910393039,0.06035291738811372,0.051572540972526365,0.06281306564554366,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.04810917005543733,0.05374749866906953,0.05718719422879538,0.0490796527755126,1.0,0.02969016341541213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The beleagued Fil-American Forces held out in a hopeless cause on the Bataan Peninsula and on Corregidor Island until the final surrender on May 7, 1942. By then the Japanese Military Administration of the Philippines had efficiently taken control of all aspects of the Philippine government and economy. Postal service had been reopened in Manila on March 4, 1942.
As the war dragged on, the Philippines became an enemy-occupied backwater in the Pacific Theater, under the heel of a repressive and sometimes brutal enemy. With few diversions permitted or possible, the Filipinos embraced stamp collecting to a degree not seen before nor since. By the latter part of 1942, they flocked to the post office to prepare First Day Covers of every new postal emission in relatively enormous quantity.
Many students of the philately of the Greater East Asia War were blind-sided by that proliferation of purely philatelic material, and overlooked the fact that a civil postal system operated with considerable efficiency during the occupation, and that the study of the postal history of the period is as fascinating and rewarding as that of any country.

Comedian and radio and TV personality Meshel Laurie was once Michelle Laurie, whose story begins in Queensland. Michelle survived her Catholic schooldays but by Year Nine had morphed into Meshel, who daydreamed of moving to Melbourne - home of Dogs in Space and the back room of the Espy.
Meshel's insider's perspective on the 1990s comedy scene is intimate and more than a little surprising. She paints a picture of a close-knit environment and tells before-they-were-famous stories about up-and-comers who are today's household names, and about the kindness of comic superstars she encountered along the way: Dave Hughes, Julia Morris, Rove, Wil Anderson, Wendy Harmer and others. We find out about the workings of an inner-city brothel, what it's like to be 'the girl on Rove' and how fence-painting can help save a life.

318140,17661390,Brand Strategy 101: Your Logo Is Irrelevant - The 3 Step Process to Build a Kick-Ass Brand,en-GB,"Your Logo Is Irrelevant. No really, it is. Let me explain.
It turns out that drooling dogs and ringing bells are far more important than a logo (thank you Pavlov).
Sure, successful businesses have logos--easily recognizable logos. Playboy, McDonald's, Coke. But there's far more to their success than bunny ears, golden arches or a certain shade of red. Stripped of all the marketing lingo, branding is pretty simple: Your brand is all the associations that come to mind when your potential customers see or hear your name.
Whether your focus is on personal branding or on branding your company culture--you've got to have more than a fancy logo and edgy color scheme to create brand stickability (you know, a brand your customers can't get out of their heads).
Well, there's a process to capturing attention and getting your foot in the door of your customers' minds. Here's a taste of some of the personal branding advice you'll find in this book:
You must become the first solution your customer thinks of when they have a problem you can solve. How?
The first step is to figure out what your audience cares about. What keeps them up at night? What problems can you help them solve? From there, you need to apply these three steps:
1) Frequency
2) Repetition
3) Anchoring
In this e-book, we'll show you how to figure out what your customers really want. Then we will show you how to apply these three steps to help you become the trusted resource that comes to mind first when your customer's itch needs to be scratched.
Is real and authentic branding going to happen overnight? Probably not. But ask yourself this: Do you want short-term results that lose effectiveness? Or are you willing to invest a bit more time and effort to create long-term results that get better and better?
If you're looking for a branding book that promises a quick fix, this isn't the book for you. But if you want to create a brand that sticks like superglue--read this book!
Go ahead and let the wimps and whiners have the get-rich quick schemes that fizzle and fall flat like a wet firework. You want to ignite a branding bonfire.","['17700975', '17979009', '5281751', '17381296', '18625873', '18802013', '18068346', '21631309', '18876967', '18933114', '18883134', '25965112', '18744968']",131.0,33.0,8.0,3.34,0.06420745389049755,0.06259502196068702,0.06428036851859976,0.06150127250492872,1.0,1.0,0.06715972120020594,0.05016270258060301,0.06066682814409804,1.0,0.0570833907660626,1.0,0.03715535730163644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

and the only survivors are two children from Charleston, South Carolina, on their way to visit their uncle in Adelaide. Mary and her younger brother Peter set out on foot, lost in the vast, hot Australian outback. They are saved by a chance meeting with an Aboriginal boy on walkabout, who teaches them to find food and water in the wilderness, but whom Mary can't bring herself to trust.
Though on the surface Walkaboutis an adventure story, darker themes lie just beneath. Peter's innocent friendship with the Aboriginal throws into relief Mary's no longer childish anxiety, and together raise questions about how Aboriginal and Western culture can meet. And in the vivid descriptions of the natural world, we realize that this story--a deep fairy tale in the spirit of Adalbert Stifter's Rock Crystal--must also be a story about the closeness of death and the power of nature.","['2694679', '1133082', '1196467', '1357517', '1474196', '1548563', '400783', '1087686', '1771748', '900574', '2657784', '416342', '3174495', '2137777', '6368443']",8.0,125.0,2.0,3.49,0.11932358642187976,1.0,0.10055702494259966,0.12466935577647831,0.14020054091203346,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.10528866534887174,0.11586967024806112,0.10233096901681585,0.12313898179418643,0.10557793056592396,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

254682,1060647,Music Hall  Modernity: Late Victorian Discovery Of Popular Culture,eng,"The late-Victorian discovery of the music hall by English intellectuals marks a crucial moment in the history of popular culture. Music Hall and Modernitydemonstrates how such pioneering cultural critics as Arthur Symons and Elizabeth Robins Pennell used the music hall to secure and promote their professional identity as guardians of taste and national welfare. These social arbiters were, at the same time, devotees of the spontaneous culture of ""the people.""
In examining fiction from Walter Besant, Hall Caine, and Henry Nevinson, performance criticism from William Archer and Max Beerbohm, and late-Victorian controversies over philanthropy and moral reform, scholar Barry Faulk argues that discourse on music-hall entertainment helped consolidate the identity and tastes of an emergent professional class. Critics and writers legitimized and cleaned up the music hall, at the same time allowing issues of class, respect, and empowerment to be negotiated.
Music Hall and Modernityoffers a complex view of the new middle-class, middle-brow, mass culture of late-Victorian London and contributes to a body of scholarship on nineteenth-century urbanism. The book will also interest scholars concerned with the emergence of a professional managerial class and the genealogy of cultural studies.",[],3.0,256.0,1.0,3.33,0.04821154209731546,0.051778719576331476,0.047424306985037704,1.0,1.0,0.06463430824612795,0.058506909541491604,0.06011401409680186,0.04434073359643071,1.0,0.04873701691718486,1.0,0.03227466725791678,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Attorney Tim Farnsworth thought he had recovered from a disorder that compels him to walk to the point of exhaustion. But now his walking disease has returned and shows no sign of going into remission. His wife, Jane, supportive beyond measure, does everything she can to keep Tim safe during his walks, including making routine midnight trips to pick him up. As the disorder takes increasing control over their lives, however, the sacrifices they make for each other drive them further apart.

Even the walls have eyes. The Republic of Venice watches and listens, then passes judgment swiftly and definitively.
In a city where everyone is assumed guilty of something, a young stonemason by the name of Michele has been accused of a crime he didn't commit. Afraid for his life, he flees the city aboard a galley carrying gold coin, leaving behind his young wife, Bianca. Banished from his home, Michele embarks on a series of extraordinary adventures as the ship he travels on stops in every port and on every island of the Mediterranean. In order to survive this once naive and immature boy must fast become a man, one possessed of cunning, courage and fortitude.
Bianca remains alone in the cruel and treacherous Venice. She faces challenges that are, if anything, even more difficult than those of Michele, and will encounter all the terrors and mysteries that the labyrinthine city holds in its blind alleys and narrow passageways. And she, like Michele, will discover in herself a tenacious and indestructible will to survive.

159486,13426114,The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially Ourselves,eng,"The New York Times bestselling author of Predictably Irrationaland The Upside of Irrationalityreturns with thought-provoking work to challenge our preconceptions about dishonesty and urge us to take an honest look at ourselves.
Does the chance of getting caught affect how likely we are to cheat?
How do companies pave the way for dishonesty?
Does collaboration make us more honest or less so?
Does religion improve our honesty?
Most of us think of ourselves as honest, but, in fact, we all cheat. From Washington to Wall Street, the classroom to the workplace, unethical behavior is everywhere. None of us is immune, whether it's the white lie to head off trouble or padding our expense reports. In The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty, award-winning, bestselling author Dan Ariely turns his unique insight and innovative research to the question of dishonesty.
Generally, we assume that cheating, like most other decisions, is based on a rational cost-benefit analysis. But Ariely argues, and then demonstrates, that it's actually the irrational forces that we don't take into account that often determine whether we behave ethically or not. For every Enron or political bribe, there are countless puffed resumes, hidden commissions, and knockoff purses. In The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty, Ariely shows why some things are easier to lie about; how getting caught matters less than we think; and how business practices pave the way for unethical behavior, both intentionally and unintentionally. Ariely explores how unethical behavior works in the personal, professional, and political worlds, and how it affects all of us, even as we think of ourselves as having high moral standards.
But all is not lost. Ariely also identifies what keeps us honest, pointing the way for achieving higher ethics in our everyday lives. With compelling personal and academic findings, The (Honest) Truth About Dishonestywill change the way we see ourselves, our actions, and others.","['10929824', '9272404', '11382184', '11437838', '11938818', '11516274', '13237713', '7783191', '7873438', '13035774', '11976774', '9310316', '226665', '11361213', '13384559', '125819']",8673.0,264.0,680.0,3.91,1.0,0.08536546634898429,0.08267486628119365,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.083007013047725,0.07870310661741002,0.0699284093715918,0.07602620588450135,0.0743305126747845,0.08725758246094538,0.05864948118904365,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But it's harder to understand why we can't seem to stop eating -- even when we know better. When we want so badly to say ""no,"" why do we continue to reach for food?
Dr. David Kessler, the dynamic former FDA commissioner who reinvented the food label and tackled the tobacco industry, cracks the code of overeating by explaining how our bodies and minds are changed when we consume foods that contain sugar, fat, and salt. Food manufacturers create products by manipulating these ingredients to stimulate our appetites, setting in motion a cycle of desire and consumption that ends with a nation of overeaters. The End of Overeatingexplains for the first time why it is exceptionally difficult to resist certain foods and why it's so easy to overindulge.
Dr. Kessler presents groundbreaking research, along with what is sure to be a controversial view inside the industry that continues to feed a our nation -- from popular brand manufacturers to advertisers, chain restaurants, and fast food franchises. Dr. Kessler's cutting-edge investigation offers new insights and useful tools to help us find a solution.

193790,10296957,The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society,eng,"""I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.""
January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb.
As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends--and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society--born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island--boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.
Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.
Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.","['2641307', '4618898', '1379961', '227571', '2017056', '250729', '6643090', '7274337', '4313522', '3367956', '83083', '11922297', '6457081', '6383944', '352965', '397844', '5066978', '13628812']",46.0,280.0,10.0,4.12,0.12585829309007393,1.0,0.10159903015555195,0.1224101007810066,1.0,0.12213877748643037,1.0,1.0,0.10756414690954492,0.09465768250886858,0.11543299564207386,0.12440280303409987,0.1350221048315028,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Boris Bobrinskoy's The Mystery of the Church is founded on the same meticulous research and reflection that characterized the previous volume, The Mystery of the Trinity (SVS Press, 1999).
In this weeping survey the author traces the Church's history, from her Old Testament roots through the formal establishment under the New Covenant and from the formative period of the Great Councils to her current standing among the many Christian confessions that have emerged since then. In his enduring devotion to the Orthodox understanding of the work of Christ and the Holy Spirit as ""the two hands of the Father,"", Bobrinskoy brings his considerable knowledge and experience to bear in expressing and witnessing to the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church as the instrument of God's saving grace for all mankind.

Curing mercurial Savvel seems an impossible task, made even more impossible when Sarid's sister, Yelse, turns up in disguise, seeking vengeance for old wrongs. Wrongs done their family by Rischa and Savvel's royal kin. Rischa is taken in by Yelse's deceptive charms, and most people begin blaming Sarid for her sister's handiwork: the blights and deaths plaguing the countryside.

Now is not the time for Carmen to fall in love. And Jeremy is hands-down the wrong guy for her to fall for. He is infuriating, arrogant, and the only person who can stand in the way of Carmen getting the one thing she wants most: to win the prestigious Guarneri competition. Carmen's whole life is violin, and until she met Jeremy, her whole focus was winning. But what if Jeremy isn't just hot--what if Jeremy is better?
Carmen knows that kissing Jeremy can't end well, but she just can't stay away. Nobody else understands her--and riles her up--like he does. Still, she can't trust him with her biggest secret: She is so desperate to win, she takes antianxiety drugs to perform, and what started as an easy fix has become a hungry addiction. Carmen is sick of not feeling anything on stage and even sicker of always doing what she's told, doing what's expected.

Denis Tanner was a member of Victoria Police in 1984, when his sister-in-law Jenny was found shot dead at her home outside the village of Bonnie Doon. Eleven years later the remains of a transsexual prostitute, Adele Bailey, were found in the nearby hills. Rumour linked Denis Tanner to both deaths, and a massive police operation was launched. In 1997 a coronial inquest found him responsible for Jenny's murder.
Yet years of surveillance had failed to produce any evidence that would allow police to charge Denis Tanner with a crime. He has never had a day in court or a chance to clear his name. The only court in which he has been charged is the court of public opinion.
In Blackened Tanner: The Denis Tanner Story, former detective Ron Irwin shows in forensic detail how Denis Tanner was wrongly accused and reveals one of the most disturbing miscarriages of justice in Australian history.
This book uncovers the incompetence and tunnel vision that led police astray and exposes how media outlets became Tanner's judge and jury. Ron's persistent search for the truth led him to reinvestigate the case himself, using the skills he honed in his career investigating crime. He has written this book to set the record straight and make the case for a new inquest, which he is sure will declare Denis Tanner innocent.",[],9.0,289.0,5.0,4.14,1.0,0.08007001120995683,1.0,0.08538615479202583,1.0,0.07254570918415115,0.07753743970319496,0.08301865394712474,0.09977052167210544,0.06833105826863342,1.0,0.07811058640890431,0.05574576111953857,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Seeking inspiration for a new font design in an antique store in small-town Stillwater, Minnesota, graphic designer Carolyn Porter stumbled across a bundle of letters and was immediately drawn to their beautifully expressive pen-and-ink handwriting. She could not read the letters--they were in French--but she noticed all of them had been signed by a man named Marcel and mailed from Berlin to his family in France during the middle of World War II.
As Carolyn grappled with designing the font, she decided to have one of Marcel's letters translated. Reading it opened a portal to a different time, and what began as mere curiosity quickly became an obsession with finding out why the letter writer, Marcel Heuze, had been in Berlin, how his letters came to be on sale in a store halfway around the world, and, most importantly, whether he ever returned to his beloved wife and daughters after the war.
Marcel's Lettersis the incredible story of Carolyn's increasingly desperate search to uncover the mystery of one man's fate during WWII, seeking answers across Germany, France, and the United States.

Anxious to protect Chloe from the emotional perils of growing up too fast too soon, Vance must confront the sexual hypocrisies of small-town life in Willoughby, Alabama-- including his own.
Guiding him on his journey is a cast of strong women: his best friend and former lover, Campbell, whose bisexuality is a source of conflict with both her own overbearing father and ex-husband; his current girlfriend, Sadie, the aspiring Liz Phair-influenced songwriter whose fiery confidence Vance admires and envies; and Deb, the ex-wife whose unexpected reappearance in his daughter's life sends him spiraling into self-destructive jealousy.
Central to understanding Chloe's entry into adulthood is yet another iconic female, the Aphrodite of Knidos. As the first nude in Western art, this Greek masterpiece--an alabaster reproduction of which is the centerpiece of the statuary Vance is dedicated to preserving--symbolizes the thin line between objectification and self-possession, between eros and the erotic.
Raising Aphrodite is a funny and poignant exploration of the misadventures of manhood that celebrates the creativity of punk rock, the importance of art in a community, and the beauty of friendship between the sexes.","['6408441', '591263', '218851', '1193672', '2781126', '1891534', '378813', '189109', '23197316', '861572', '6056346', '367625', '7823598', '4926', '321623', '5984292']",15.0,432.0,6.0,3.88,1.0,0.0720208919302723,0.07759299344943718,0.06870184758743753,1.0,0.07772515470048104,0.07608577626015901,0.06663455694244504,0.07593422128821582,0.07553128639207682,1.0,1.0,0.04673426721113689,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Sarah Midnight is no ordinary teenager. She is a demon hunter, caught up in one of the deadliest wars unknown to man. Orphaned at the age of sixteen, Sarah learned the family trade of hunting without her parents to guide her but under the watchful eye of her 'cousin', who was revealed to be Sean Hannay, no relative at all, but a dear friend of the real Harry Midnight.
Now, in the exciting sequel to ""Dreams"", the fight continues. Sarah and Sean may have defeated the Scottish Valaya, but the rest of the war still rages on, and Sarah, Sean, Nicholas and their companions must unearth the identity and location of the Enemy - the leader of the demons - before the world plunges into the Time of Demons once more. Their quest leads them to Sarah's family home, the Midnight mansion in Islay, and there they discover horrible truths about the demon ruler, his plans, and Sarah's own personal history.
Along the way, Sarah must battle not only the demons but her hurt toward Sean and her feelings for the enigmatic Nicholas, who has plans of his own.","['17224777', '13596185', '3176211', '18276437', '12159502', '12734235', '18072225', '10591268', '6750305', '12373428', '12776668', '18190078', '17262294', '9003770', '17119447', '13552772', '18482292']",187.0,416.0,28.0,3.98,1.0,1.0,0.10782590714712915,0.10040972300005216,0.13696836380545405,0.138846360397675,1.0,0.13717585799978751,0.14167313350661262,0.0874579064099254,0.11827795792667765,0.11690325847894316,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Stephen King's second collection features 22 works, comprising nineteen short stories, a novella (The Mist), and two poems ('Paranoid: A Chant' and 'For Owen,' the poem he wrote for his son). In addition to the introduction, in which the author directly addresses his readers in his now familiar conversational style, Skeleton Crewfeatures an epilogue of sorts entitled 'Notes' wherein King discusses the origins of several stories in the collection.
Although published in 1985, the stories collected in Skeleton Crewspan seventeen years from 'The Reaper's Image' (King's second professional sale when he was just eighteen years old) to 'The Ballad of The Flexible Bullet', which was completed in 1983
Of one of the stories in the collection, King says: ""As far as short stories are concerned, I like the grisly ones the best. However the story 'Survivor Type' goes a little bit too far, even for me.""
The acclaimed artist Pete Von Sholly (who produced the storyboards for Frank Darabont's movie adaptation of The Mist) has provided a piece of artwork for each story plus covers, slipcases and endpapers. Pete has also delivered 26 pieces of original artwork which will be given away--signed by the artist--with copies of the deluxe lettered edition of this bumper thirtieth anniversary event, which includes an Introduction from the multiple award-winning Horror maestro, Stephen Jones.

V. S. Ramachandran is at the forefront of his field-so much so that Richard Dawkins dubbed him the ""Marco Polo of neuroscience."" Now, in a major new work, Ramachandran sets his sights on the mystery of human uniqueness. Taking us to the frontiers of neurology, he reveals what baffling and extreme case studies can teach us about normal brain function and how it evolved. Synesthesia becomes a window into the brain mechanisms that make some of us more creative than others. And autism--for which Ramachandran opens a new direction for treatment--gives us a glimpse of the aspect of being human that we understand least: self-awareness. Ramachandran tackles the most exciting and controversial topics in neurology with a storyteller's eye for compelling case studies and a researcher's flair for new approaches to age-old questions. Tracing the strange links between neurology and behavior, this book unveils a wealth of clues into the deepest mysteries of the human brain. 15 black-and-white illustrations","['7170963', '7766914', '151132', '3290105', '3281', '4075', '81744', '947061', '6719017', '11346470', '9807852', '11213439', '5895503', '8385283', '8018107', '452777', '13530563', '125257']",174.0,421.0,8.0,4.12,0.07435677526913208,0.07836983737907437,0.06613205483401989,0.0815799802485058,0.07460841117019805,1.0,1.0,0.05183638180432918,1.0,0.05639784729084102,1.0,0.06695902692845658,0.03242754673291222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

At once humane and horrifying, Under the Skin takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory-our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion. A grotesque and comical allegory, a surreal representation of contemporary society run amok, Under the Skin has been internationally received as the arrival of an exciting talent, rich and assured.","['659059', '70277', '223669', '119115', '12006', '925775', '3433301', '289166', '441142', '124893', '526164', '683006', '1136604', '373967', '468595', '1001309', '67719', '23050']",138.0,320.0,20.0,3.72,1.0,1.0,0.05193301299896051,0.05277747935039136,1.0,1.0,0.056953268101778184,0.0508623250221427,0.05484993224189481,0.053442168604460105,0.05451735677794481,0.058283400541849585,0.03007747143251148,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

344680,10805219,Prosperity Without Growth: Economics for a Finite Planet,eng,"Is more economic growth the solution? Will it deliver prosperity and well-being for a global population projected to reach nine billion? In this explosive book, Tim Jackson - a top sustainability adviser to the UK government - makes a compelling case against continued economic growth in developed nations.
No one denies that development is essential for poorer nations. But in the advanced economies there is mounting evidence that ever-increasing consumption adds little to human happiness and may even impede it. More urgently, it is now clear that the ecosystems that sustain our economies are collapsing under the impacts of rising consumption. Unless we can radically lower the environmental impact of economic activity - and there is no evidence to suggest that we can - we will have to devise a path to prosperity that does not rely on continued growth.
Economic heresy? Or an opportunity to improve the sources of well-being, creativity and lasting prosperity that lie outside the realm of the market? Tim Jackson provides a credible vision of how human society can flourish i 1/2 within the ecological limits of a finite planet. Fulfilling this vision is simply the most urgent task of our times.
This book is a substantially revised and updated version of Jackson's controversial study for the Sustainable Development Commission, an advisory body to the UK Government. The study rapidly became the most downloaded report in the Commission's nine year history when it was launched earlier this year.

It's a profile, like all the others on the online dating site. But as NYPD Detective Kat Donovan focuses on the accompanying picture, she feels her whole world explode, as emotions she's ignored for decades come crashing down on her. Staring back at her is her ex-fiance Jeff, the man who shattered her heart--and who she hasn't seen in 18 years.
Kat feels a spark, wondering if this might be the moment when past tragedies recede and a new world opens up to her. But when she reaches out to the man in the profile, her reawakened hope quickly darkens into suspicion and then terror as an unspeakable conspiracy comes to light, in which monsters prey upon the most vulnerable.
As the body count mounts and Kat's hope for a second chance with Jeff grows more and more elusive, she is consumed by an investigation that challenges her feelings about everyone she ever loved--her former fiance, her mother, and even her father, whose cruel murder so long ago has never been fully explained. With lives on the line, including her own, Kat must venture deeper into the darkness than she ever has before, and discover if she has the strength to survive what she finds there.","['18079661', '18667959', '23398840', '7243435', '21408719', '17910538', '18404195', '18667817', '20736539', '17333227', '18594594', '18144154', '15755201', '18774963', '18635057', '16044993', '23848084']",71.0,399.0,19.0,3.96,1.0,0.1415934100523732,1.0,0.13407426919653734,1.0,0.1384354088399803,0.14808914454743483,0.11458445629678174,0.1432228691412591,0.11377657081406065,1.0,0.14800631510592485,0.08763817040801122,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
306635,591463,Learning Capoeira: Lessons in Cunning from an Afro-Brazilian Art,eng,"Learning Capoeira: Lessons in Cunning from an Afro-Brazilian Artis a provocative look at capoeira, a demanding acrobatic art that combines dance, ritual, music, and fighting style. First created by slaves, freedmen, and gang members, capoeira is a study in contrasts that integrates African-descended rhythms and flowing dance steps with hard lessons from the street. According to veteran teachers, capoeira will transform novices, instilling in them a sense of malicia, or ""cunning,"" and changing how they walk, hear, and interact.
Learning Capoeirais an ethnographic study based on author Greg Downey's extensive research about capoeira and more than ten years of apprenticeship. It looks at lessons from traditional capoeira teachers in Salvador, Brazil, capturing the spoken and unspoken ways in which they pass on the art to future generations. Downey explores how bodily training can affect players' perceptions and social interactions, both within the circular roda, the ""ring"" where the game takes place, as well as outside it, in their daily lives. He brings together an experience-centered, phenomenological analysis of the art with recent discoveries in psychology and the neurosciences about the effects of physical education on perception. The text is enhanced by more than twenty photos of capoeira sessions, many taken by veteran teacher, Mestre Cobra Mansa.
Learning Capoeirabreaks from many contemporary trends in cultural studies of all sorts, looking at practice, education, music, nonverbal communication, perception, and interaction. It will be of interest to students of African Diaspora culture, performance, sport, and anthropology. For anyone who has wondered how physical training affects our perceptions, this close study of capoeira will open new avenues for understanding how culture shapes the ways we carry ourselves and see the world.",[],34.0,288.0,2.0,3.74,1.0,0.05964329245130729,0.05399644611539165,1.0,1.0,0.064777878460327,0.059705947082584886,0.05907958936973335,0.05084463984162872,1.0,0.04959629411870971,0.06374042859096783,0.04177111917237205,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Despite some reservations, the Caleighs move in, searching for respite in this beautiful part of North Devon, seeking peace and perhaps to come to terms with what's happened to them as a family.

Likely to become the standard work in English, the book treats the entire Iberian Peninsula and all of the people who inhabited it, from the coming of the Visigoths to the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella.
Integrating a wealth of information about the diverse peoples, institutions, religions, and customs that flourished in the states that are now Spain and Portugal, Professor O'Callaghan focuses on the continuing attempts to impose political unity on the peninsula. He divides his story into five compact historical periods and discusses political, social, economic, and cultural developments in each period. By treating states together, he is able to put into proper perspective the relationship among them, their similarities and differences, and the continuity of development from one period to the next. He gives proper attention to Spain's contacts with the rest of the medieval world, but his main concern is with the events and institutions on the peninsula itself.
Illustrations, genealogical charts, maps, and an extensive bibliography round out the book. It will be welcomed by teachers of Spanish and Portuguese history and literature, as well as by medievalists, as the fullest account to date of Spanish history in the Middle Ages.",[],61.0,728.0,8.0,3.9,0.08058733583248213,0.08434219211560089,0.07088417441731709,1.0,1.0,0.07477740001560261,1.0,1.0,0.07672638522160767,0.06919225698876909,0.07366140822639282,0.08260869517225261,0.07936069691475008,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In book one of this new post-apocalyptic survival fiction series, 36 HOURS, the reader was provided a glimpse into the rapid decline of society once word of the catastrophic solar flare racing towards Earth began to spread.
Book two, ZERO HOUR, thrust our character into the perils of a post-apocalyptic world. At Zero Hour, an EMP caused by a massive solar flare left America in darkness. The Ryman family, who weren't preppers, applied common sense, logic, and a will to survive to their decision-making as they faced death, their hostile neighbors, and the depravity of man.
Now, in Book three, TURNING POINT, the Rymans face a life altering decision - should we stay or should we go? The oldest and strongest emotion in man is fear, and the strongest kind of fear, is fear of the unknown. Will Americans flee the urban centers - the proverbial golden hordes - for the countryside? Will it be safer than the cities? TURNING POINT will lead the Ryman family into a complex, inexplicable world where danger lurks around every bend.

Anne-Sophia Duncombe is ruined, a victim of her father's high-stakes gambling. Stolen moments at the piano are her boon. Wilhelm Montegue is a washed up war hero, rumored insane. His ""condition"" - modern diagnosis: savant autism - is the source of his gift for composing music. Anne-Sophia and Wilhelm thought they had missed their chance for love, but anything can happen in the music room.
Anne-Sophia is in exile, hiding from her villainous father, Lord Chauncey, who tried to force her into marrying the repulsive Lowdry, his partner in crime. She outsmarted them and ran away, but loneliness is its own captivity. As a last resort before the convent, Sophia attempts a radical scheme--a life of humility and disguise.
Wilhelm Montegue, Earl of Devon, is a washed-up war hero who drinks too much, offends his neighbors with his harsh wit, and breaks furniture when his temper flares. Always in the shadow of scandal and absent from society, he is the subject of intense gossip. The town whispers that he is insane and guilty of unnatural proclivities. He is barely excused by his brilliant mind and swarthy good looks.
Lord Devon is bewildered that his newest housemaid has sparked such an irritating fascination in him. Why must she be the most exquisite woman he ever laid eyes on? Chaste and bound by honor, he vows to behave himself, even if her voice is a siren song. He knows she is keeping secrets, and he finds her scent of danger intoxicating . . . .","['18143986', '15709100', '35478693', '12769479', '613972', '13545596', '11100750', '13594719', '17969763', '197420', '12795944', '8676331', '13411560', '9755694', '902812', '13239146', '23723798', '1328608']",273.0,300.0,9.0,3.9,1.0,0.09509901294653209,0.09850529296974159,0.08358285853757137,1.0,0.08829211106947207,0.09663284558145843,0.10502826649604499,0.08970910251459165,0.1070265430748439,0.09905302987658486,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Its close accounts of friendship since boyhood with two men surely unknown to Dom and certainly to each other is interleaved with the story of Dom himself. This narrative which at first seems beamed from the narrator's fear that he may have helped cause Dom's supposed suicide, opens into the violent geography of Dom's career as late-Sixties activist-ideologue.
It is in one of Dom's ideas -- the physicist's field-state turned into the psychic space of human community -- that the narrator imagines a new way of gauging relationships. Experiences ambush him, memorable, measurably ominous yet open -- a boy's deep and almost disappearing dive into a mountain quarry pool; the flight of a boomerang thrown from the Brooklyn Bridge out toward the Statue of Liberty. New sectors swing into the narrator's account of middle-class life in the Brooklyn Heights of the 1940s and 50s. Delicate anatomies of old girlfriends performed with nostalgic instinct; anxious confidences, painful and building, roused now by the narrator's thoughts of his daughter, his wife, and the son from her first marriage.
All the while, the two friends Al (from the country) and Bob (from the city) grow toward each other on these pages, as Dom, increasingly alive, seems increasingly distant. Yet at last -- as if by some strange grace of nature -- the narrator is given a sense of his own life very like the field-state into which he has tried to work his way by use of a controlling craft: the craft of an anthropologist ... that of an only child dwelling on friendships ... that of an artist looking for America both in its public stars like Dom and more faithfully in familiar mysteries of private life.","['606234', '266753', '156183', '45679', '24481', '16076779', '1168892', '7697487', '596358', '582079', '28440', '744447', '164619', '162950', '587393']",15.0,260.0,8.0,4.15,0.17265679596070857,0.17153232057566972,0.1682811420024696,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.17049902474438675,0.1681678278059588,0.16284469647475971,0.1525841464934328,0.1627070865272646,1.0,0.11313100002262105,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Warm, funny and insightful, The Fly Trap is a meditation on collecting; be it hoverflies or fine art. A fascinating web of associations, it begins with Sjoberg's own tranquil experience as an entomologist on a remote island in Sweden, and takes in heroic historical expeditions to Burma and the wilderness of Kamchatka. Along the way, Sjoberg pauses to reflect on a range of ideas - slowness, art, freedom, - drawing other great writers, like D.H Lawrence and Bruce Chatwin, into dialogue. From the everyday to the exotic, The Fly Trap revels in the wonder of the natural world and leaves a trail of memorable images and stories.","['877734', '22857252', '661405', '16088669', '12982779', '1550798', '354443', '13479925', '7218411', '12503306', '10358250', '16158510', '15853131', '1344371', '2539499', '23290697', '18365459', '6932727']",62.0,278.0,10.0,3.75,0.09184285218874097,1.0,0.0709966936051413,1.0,1.0,0.09112615337052263,0.09655988012502537,1.0,0.07721617126429602,0.07808178202994923,0.07737779913749637,0.0864165293527935,0.09112959981238038,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

54354,2594110,Del-Del,eng,"Des and Hannah and their children are a normal close-knit family or so it seems. And their young son, Sam, for all his brilliance, gives every sign of being a normal little boy. Then, quite suddenly, exactly a year after the death of the middle child, Laura, Sam starts to act peculiarly. His strange behaviour, treated at first as a 'he'll get over it' syndrome, soon takes a demonic twist which can no longer be ignored, or indeed explained. For it seems that Sam is somehow possessed by a terrifying and evil presence he calls Del-Del, and Del-Del's influence is malign to a frightening degree. Sam tries to wrestle with Del-Del in his own way, and sometimes there are periods of normality which suggest that Del-Del has finally been defeated. But Del-Del is cunning, and knows exactly how and when to strike again. Under the intolerable stress of Sam's increasingly dangerous and anarchic behaviour, the fabric of the family begins to come apart and only Sam's sister Beth has the tenacity to go on probing for the cause, to piece together every clue which could destroy Del-Del forever. Inevitably a confrontation must come, and the climax to this tense psychological thriller leads to a conclusion of quite brilliant unpredictability and excitement.
Del-Del, with its thoroughly contemporary setting and characters, is a novel so startling and original that it will no doubt win for Victor Kelleher readers of any age who respond to story-telling which grips like a vice.","['568286', '1961313', '925361', '1360081', '47920', '1089345', '1566276', '10893836', '2870983', '290480', '534721', '13101791', '1401863', '3165049', '440403', '1401165', '662786']",178.0,195.0,15.0,3.86,0.07418526622110004,0.07571951581682564,0.06871271953942595,0.05612335383433188,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.06832157757342464,1.0,0.05726161307241778,0.07960523092836905,0.07996008954993306,0.048182138272594564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

How is tonight different from all other nights? For Jacob Rappaport, a Jewish soldier in the Union army during the Civil War, it is a question his commanders have already answered for him - on Passover, 1862, he is ordered to murder his own uncle in New Orleans, who is plotting to assassinate President Lincoln. After this harrowing mission, Jacob is recruited to pursue another enemy agent, the daughter of a Virginia family friend. But this time, his assignment isn't to murder the spy but to marry her.
Based on real personalities such as Judah Benjamin, the Confederacy's Jewish secretary of state and spymaster, and on historical facts and events ranging from an African American spy network to the dramatic self-destruction of the city of Richmond, All Other Nightsis a story of men and women driven to the limits of loyalty and betrayal. It is also a parable of the rift in America that lingers a century and a half later: between those who value family and tradition first, and those dedicated, at any cost, to social and racial justice for all.","['100065', '6368197', '8343235', '7299917', '522892', '7057397', '426664', '2790156', '607084', '179443', '382431', '80746', '7270465', '197170', '28937', '2214742', '6431998', '17495285']",2067.0,363.0,358.0,3.72,0.1818010707134776,0.16586246855111078,0.17081075625534095,0.13235401435325211,1.0,0.14522716875061037,0.13518560973386554,1.0,0.15751711766408866,0.1134593047862531,1.0,0.15956789347260447,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Is Right Now
I leaned my head back and thought about the boy who was no longer really a boy.
Alex was a man.
And a tall, really tall, one at that.
The moment I'd seen him walk through the door, my heart had constricted. Painfully. It'd taken me a second to catch my breath. I'd dreamed about him all through high school, watched as he took one girl after another out around town.
I doubted he remembered the girl working the popcorn counter at the theater, but every weekend there was always a new girl on his arm, a new girl kissing him and rubbing her horny little body all over his, and it was a miracle my teeth hadn't become filed points as much as I'd ground them together.
And maybe it shouldn't surprise me that he didn't have a clue who I was; I no longer looked even remotely similar to the girl who'd graduated valedictorian of J.J. Baines High.
My fingers twitched as I remembered the feel of his body in my fist. He was big, and so damn hard my thighs had trembled.
Fire and static and electricity and whatever other chemical combustion had detonated inside me. I'd gone from zero to horny in two seconds the moment he'd walked in.
His hair had glinted so many different shades of blond, from white to burnished bronze, and all I wanted to do was touch it, run my fingers through it, wondering all the while if it was as soft as it'd looked.
One look into eyes that made me think of a sky right after a storm and I could no longer control myself.","['19336835', '18349618', '18712736', '18759624', '18522849', '18176395', '18366646', '16119191', '20549965', '25811403', '17929053', '23442062', '18363766', '19070081', '21493030', '18310103', '12115053', '20661216']",1283.0,237.0,143.0,4.08,0.19735657335849416,0.18511050864139275,0.1876782577143312,0.16536457219853426,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.14720670109804418,0.19285695032373035,0.16855041012967936,0.18730535626799538,1.0,0.11290572181852297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

But when he opens an innocuous-looking letter addressed to him at The Source, he discovers that someone else excels at ferreting out secrets as well.
Ten-year-old Charlotte Bowen has been abducted, and if Luxford does not admit publicly to having fathered her, she will die. But Charlotte's existence is Luxford's most fiercely guarded secret, and acknowledging her as his child will throw more than one life and career into chaos. Luxford knows that the story of Charlotte's paternity could make him a laughingstock and reveal to his beautiful wife and son the lie he's lived for a decade. Yet it's not only Luxford's reputation that's on the line: it's also the reputation--and career--of Charlotte Bowen's mother. For she is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office, one of the most high-profile Junior Ministers and quite possibly the next Margaret Thatcher.
Knowing that her political future hangs in the balance, Eve Bowen refuses to let Luxford damage her career by printing the story or calling the police. So the editor turns to forensic scientist Simon St. James for help. It's a case that fills St. James with disquiet, however, for none of the players in the drama seem to react the way one would expect.
Then tragedy occurs and New Scotland Yard becomes involved. Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley soon discovers that the case sends tentacles from London into the countryside, and he must simultaneously outfox death as he probes Charlotte Bowen's mysterious disappearance. Meanwhile, his partner Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, working part of the investigation on her own and hoping to make the coup of her career, may be drawing closer to a grim solution--and to danger--than anyone knows.

563317,1655714,Extinction,eng,"From the late Thomas Bernhard, arguably Austria's most influential novelist of the postwar period, and one of the greatest artists in all twentieth-century literature in the German language, his magnum opus.
Extinction, Bernhard's last work of fiction, takes the form of the autobiographical testimony of Franz-Josef Murau, the intellectual black sheep of a powerful Austrian land-owning family. Murau lives in Rome in self-imposed exile from his family, surrounded by a coterie of artistic and intellectual friends. On returning from his sister's wedding to the ""wine-cork manufacturer"" on the family estate of Wolfsegg, having resolved never to go home again, Murau receives a telegram informing him of the death of his parents and brother in a car crash. Not only must he now go back, he must do so as the master of Wolfsegg. And he must decide its fate.
Divided into two halves, Extinctionexplores Murau's rush of memories of Wolfsegg as he stands at his Roman window considering the fateful telegram, in counterpoint to his return to Wolfsegg and the preparations for the funeral itself.
Written in the seamless style for which Bernhard became famous, Extinctionis the ultimate proof of his extraordinary literary genius. It is his summing-up against Austria's treacherous past and -- in unprecedented fashion -- a revelation of his own incredibly complex personality, of his relationship with the world in which he lived, and the one he left behind.
A literary event of the first magnitude.","['265987', '6081631', '27426', '182587', '443160', '1560965', '2455799', '397112', '410138', '730376', '819564', '963680', '757972', '484274', '201737', '24482']",15.0,335.0,4.0,4.32,0.15251490570424098,0.15082116731214315,0.13612240960492233,0.14077862706561065,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.14907183439265215,0.1467901894669615,0.1205711332863595,0.14307182669145277,1.0,0.11112795489323475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Thomas Ligotti, author of The Conspiracy Against the Human Race The world is increasingly unthinkable, a world of planetary disasters, emerging pandemics, and the looming threat of extinction. In this book Eugene Thacker suggests that we look to the genre of horror as offering a way of thinking about the unthinkable world. To confront this idea is to confront the limit of our ability to understand the world in which we live - a central motif of the horror genre. In the Dust of This Planet explores these relationships between philosophy and horror. In Thacker's hands, philosophy is not academic logic-chopping; instead, it is the thought of the limit of all thought, especially as it dovetails into occultism, demonology, and mysticism. Likewise, Thacker takes horror to mean something beyond the focus on gore and scare tactics, but as the under-appreciated genre of supernatural horror in fiction, film, comics, and music.","['15845402', '4617457', '345784', '660518', '2198610', '8524528', '152125', '2199850', '604346', '3026121', '322274', '15893652', '37539', '12786229', '6763725', '13552477', '13647086']",1021.0,170.0,115.0,3.67,0.08661564389486397,1.0,0.05173734952832824,1.0,0.0757699597212746,0.07814791702226129,1.0,0.08589382157833081,1.0,0.08771536687222682,0.06630931318673661,0.057217860053892934,0.0812828987340193,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Then, when Hannah draws a portrait of Maisie, things begin to fall apart. The house seems to be reverting to its nineteenth-century form, and Hannah's not sure whether it or Maisie herself is sending her messages. Hannah must solve the mystery of Maisie's death, because if she doesn't help her, Maisie may never leave Hannah alone. . . .

When she seeks him out to ask his forgiveness, though, he will only give it on one condition: she'll have to accept the bare-bottom spanking she once falsely claimed to have been given.
Although hesitant, Naia agrees, but after a painful and humiliating punishment which leaves her tearful and blushing, Liam sends her on her way. Despite her protests he is determined not to see her again... for his sake and for hers. He knows full well how strongly he yearns to dominate and have his way with her, and he fears she is far from ready to see that side of him. But Liam isn't the only one who has to come to terms with the past, and when Naia persists, he finds himself unable to resist the twenty-eight year old beauty any longer.
Deciding to give her a taste of the life he lives, Liam brings her with him to his vacation home in Miami. He will demand her absolute obedience, thoroughly punish any defiance, and take her in any way he pleases, leaving her begging on her knees for more. But will the passion they ignite continue to burn hot once they return home?

The Radletts of Alconleigh occupy the heights of genteel eccentricity, from terrifying Lord Alconleigh (who, like Mitford's father, used to hunt his children with bloodhounds when foxes were not available), to his gentle wife, Sadie, their wayward daughter Linda, and the other six lively Radlett children.

A Philip Potter Story
Terrence Bottom wants to change the world. Little does he know the world is already changing, and his part in it won t be what he expects. A prelaw student at Columbia University, Terrence s interests range from opposing the draft and the war in Vietnam, to civil rights for gays, to anything to do with Cameron McKenzie, the rugged blond hanging around the Stonewall Inn. Too bad Cameron bolts whenever Terrence looks his way.
College dropout Cameron McKenzie left tiny Paris, Kentucky, with dreams of a career on Broadway. Although he claims to be straight, he prostitutes himself to survive. Now the Mafia is using him to entrap men for extortion schemes. He s in over his head with no way out at least not a way that doesn t involve cement shoes and a swim in the Hudson.

Sandra's concern over finding her brother, Jeff, isn't her only problem. Her pathetic excuse for super powers has left her needing a new ankle.

323718,15866872,The Comet's Tale: A Novel about Sojourner Truth,eng,"From Publishers Weekly First-timer Sheehan offers an uneven but emotionally and lyrically powerful novelization of the life of Sojourner Truth. Born Isabella at the beginning of the 19th century, the future crusader for equality and justice spends nine years on a New York State farm with her wise mother and kind father before being sold-as a lot, along with sheep, at auction. Whipped for speaking her native Dutch, she begins to talk to God: ""God is big to us, and we should speak to him under the biggest sky,"" her mother always said. So begin years of masters both kind and cruel, but none able to see her as a human-a blindness Isabella describes as one of the damages slavery inflicts on both slave and master. Though Isabella experiences indescribable horrors, she also finds love and desire; she even meets with rare self-sacrifice and aid from abolitionist whites, some helping her sue to get her son back from an illegal master. After she acquires her freedom and becomes a preacher, she falls in with a ""house of seekers"" led by a false prophet, Matthias, whom at first she stands by (""I did not survive slavery and see two husbands die of broken spirits to be put off so easily""), and from whose thrall she barely escapes. Isabella's strong, warm, distinctive voice is a genuine accomplishment, able to render tortures and prayers alike. Though the pacing is inconsistent, this is a disturbing and robust work, offering a new way of looking at one of history's greatest champions of freedom. Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Booklist Psychologist Sheehan offers a fictionalized account of the life of Sojourner Truth, relating the incredible saga of a woman who survived slavery and cruelty to become a fiery abolitionist orator. Sheehan's story is based on five years of research of public documents, including Truth's own Narrative of Sojourner Truth, which Sheehan's character describes as ""weak tea."" The novel is graphic in describing the cruelty and suffering inflicted on slave women as it explores the mental and emotional development of a young girl who is sold away from a loving family at the age of nine and thrown into the hands of a succession of cruel masters. Truth, who took her name from a divine inspiration, suffered the loss of the man she loved and later separation from her children, all the time receiving guidance from her conversations with God. Following Emancipation, she takes up with spiritualists before settling into a lifelong crusade for reparations for slaves and women's right to vote. Historical fiction fans will enjoy this sensitive portrayal of a slave woman's survival and triumph. Vanessa Bush Copyright (c) American Library Association.

The novel is told through the eyes, letters and journals of Esmond Lowndes, who comes to Italy a lonely young man in the shadow of his politician father. On the cobbles of Florence's many-storied streets, he deepens his appreciation of art and literature, and falls in love.
With the coming of war, Esmond finds himself drawn into the Tuscan Resistance, hunted by the malevolent Mario Carita, head of the Fascist secret police. With his lover, Ada, at his side, he is at the centre of assassination plots, shoot-outs and car chases, culminating in a final mission of extraordinary daring.
In Love and War is a novel that will take you deep into the secret heart of history. It is a novel of art and letters, of bawdy raconteurs and dashing spies. With Esmond Lowndes you will see the beauty of Florence and the horror of war as it sweeps over the city's terracotta rooftops. In Love and War is both epic and intimate, harrowing and heartwarming.","['23399037', '11275545', '13325868', '11448421', '24874358', '7963218', '20428638', '13502136', '1983779', '18043861', '18469743', '11314320', '17333342', '8714561', '23848253', '17164057', '10416442']",114.0,340.0,21.0,3.69,0.15333784514152027,0.13620334608918472,0.11442294436647066,0.0985033847658658,1.0,0.09349014449655221,0.13411553460030765,1.0,0.09315911308448067,0.10561606064874343,0.11087942179481271,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Are you mystified by how musicians just 'know' what notes to play next when they're improvising? Or why certain notes sound great together and others clash?
Discover the answers in this ear-opening tour of how music works. John Powell, a classically-trained composer and a physics professor, decided to write this entertaining, pain-free guide to the ingredients of music when he discovered that all the other books on the subject gave him a headache. Here he reveals the often little-known facts and fascinating science behind what we listen to, explaining the basics of harmony, scales, chords, keys and rhythm in a way that's easy for everyone to understand.
He also shows us why a note has a different sound to a normal noise, why Chinese people are more likely to have perfect pitch, and even why Beethoven and Led Zeppelin are musically similar.
This book reveals things that people who play music should know but often don't, and will help all of us - even if we can't read a note - increase our listening pleasure.","['7702335', '141566', '436797', '135378', '928838', '2145045', '11797453', '848522', '117454', '6486885', '305125', '2907545', '401550', '375579', '7962206', '340939', '18050103']",65.0,416.0,12.0,3.96,0.06545003285222792,0.06880596802671374,0.05801969037986512,1.0,0.07508416492547061,1.0,1.0,0.05743820927972896,0.06619840030041178,1.0,0.06884801041742934,0.07509854117337533,0.042601009378678764,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

After Pikettyopens with a discussion by Arthur Goldhammer, the book's translator, of the reasons for Capital's phenomenal success, followed by the published reviews of Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Robert Solow. The rest of the book is devoted to newly commissioned essays that interrogate Piketty's arguments. Suresh Naidu and other contributors ask whether Piketty said enough about power, slavery, and the complex nature of capital. Laura Tyson and Michael Spence consider the impact of technology on inequality. Heather Boushey, Branko Milanovic, and others consider topics ranging from gender to trends in the global South.

The greatest deceptions are never suspected. After twenty years with the Tararian Selective Service, Cris Sietinen is in the unprecedented position of being both Lead Agent and heir to a High Dynasty. Family, career, information--it would seem he has it all. But when his fourteen-year-old son, Wil, is captured by the mysterious Bakzen, Cris is forced to question all that he once took for granted in his life. Only one thing remains clear: it's imperative he rescue Wil. What Cris and Wil learn in the process will change their perception forever.
Veil of Reality is the second installment in the Cadicle series. This fast-paced adventure novel with intrigue, danger and self-discovery begins to untie the knot of secrets binding the TSS, High Dynasties and the Priesthood.
Is it possible to change destiny? The Cadicle series follows three generations of the pivotal Sietinen Dynasty as each learns their part in an elaborately orchestrated galactic conflict. Torn by politics, love and war, the Cadicle and those he holds most dear must choose between duty and morality as the true nature of their purpose unfolds. Through their roles as Agents in the Tararian Selective Service, they will be on the front lines of space battles, but the political skirmishes they must face on Tararia could prove just as dangerous.

349194,823827,My Name is Red,en-GB,"Orhan Pamuk is one of Turkey's premier novelists and My Name Is Red, when published in the original Turkish in 1998, became the fastest-selling book in Turkish history. It is high time then that a translation to English was made, and this publication will be widely welcomed by Pamuk's growing legion of English-speaking admirers. In the late 16th century, during the final years of the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat III, a great work is commissioned, a book celebrating the Sultan's life. The work is conducted in secret, to the ignorance of the artists involved, for fear of a violent religious reaction to the European style of the illuminations in the book. An artist goes, missing, feared dead, and Black, a painter who has been in a self-enforced exile because of spurned love, returns to help his former Master investigate the disappearance. 
Pamuk's prose is as exquisite and rich as the elucidations it describes. This is a dense, atmospherically fevered book, which demands a high level of patience and attention from the reader, perhaps mirroring the patience of the miniaturists. Written in the first person, with multiple narratives, this is a book full of unreliable witnesses, and as the various stories of the narrators unfold, the truth of the disappearance slowly emerges. The sense of place and time are carefully constructed and diligently maintained throughout the novel, which, like Umberto Eco's The Name Of The Rose, far exceeds the genre of literary historical crime to become a hypnotic meditation on religion, love, time, patience and artistic devotion. --Iain Robinson

560631,17287028,My Story,eng,"For the first time, ten years after her abduction from her Salt Lake City bedroom, Elizabeth Smart reveals how she survived and the secret to forging a new life in the wake of a brutal crime.
On June 5, 2002, fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart, the daughter of a close-knit Mormon family, was taken from her home in the middle of the night by religious fanatic, Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. She was kept chained, dressed in disguise, repeatedly raped, and told she and her family would be killed if she tried to escape. After her rescue on March 12, 2003, she rejoined her family and worked to pick up the pieces of her life.
Now for the first time, in her memoir, MY STORY, she tells of the constant fear she endured every hour, her courageous determination to maintain hope, and how she devised a plan to manipulate her captors and convinced them to return to Utah, where she was rescued minutes after arriving. Smart explains how her faith helped her stay sane in the midst of a nightmare and how she found the strength to confront her captors at their trial and see that justice was served.
In the nine years after her rescue, Smart transformed from victim to advocate, traveling the country and working to educate, inspire and foster change. She has created a foundation to help prevent crimes against children and is a frequent public speaker. In 2012, she married Matthew Gilmour, whom she met doing mission work in Paris for her church, in a fairy tale wedding that made the cover of Peoplemagazine.","['11922297', '48991', '15718698', '18154106', '18633870', '17926571', '777081', '17210417', '22572841', '8971659', '7997566', '2216812', '12518592', '18394534', '15833693', '17333444', '17193561', '15818562']",24005.0,308.0,3472.0,3.78,0.21562265646401627,0.21248994116275943,0.21660563688310602,0.21234638199049627,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2159567006036641,0.2099967046757137,0.17214874733545146,0.21249203837416425,1.0,0.1468200186033284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Further, suppose that these same manuscripts could help us extract from Genesis the timelines for the development of life on Earth, precisely as identified by the latest scientific evidence from the fossil record.
The Genesis One Codeoffers a careful examination of the relationship between scientific theory and biblical teaching. The book targets the origins debate from a fresh perspective informed by scientific and spiritual research.

180833,2422710,Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight,eng,"As Apollo 11's Lunar Module descended toward the moon under automatic control, a program alarm in the guidance computer's software nearly caused a mission abort. Neil Armstrong responded by switching off the automatic mode and taking direct control. He stopped monitoring the computer and began flying the spacecraft, relying on skill to land it and earning praise for a triumph of human over machine. In Digital Apollo, engineer-historian David Mindell takes this famous moment as a starting point for an exploration of the relationship between humans and computers in the Apollo program. In each of the six Apollo landings, the astronaut in command seized control from the computer and landed with his hand on the stick. Mindell recounts the story of astronauts' desire to control their spacecraft in parallel with the history of the Apollo Guidance Computer. From the early days of aviation through the birth of spaceflight, test pilots and astronauts sought to be more than ""spam in a can"" despite the automatic controls, digital computers, and software developed by engineers.
Digital Apolloexamines the design and execution of each of the six Apollo moon landings, drawing on transcripts and data telemetry from the flights, astronaut interviews, and NASA's extensive archives. Mindell's exploration of how human pilots and automated systems worked together to achieve the ultimate in flight -- a lunar landing -- traces and reframes the debate over the future of humans and automation in space. The results have implications for any venture in which human roles seem threatened by automated systems, whether it is the work at our desktops or the future of exploration.","['1526298', '282086', '213301', '10370206', '10530950', '271540', '2323178', '1767720', '141498', '236866', '78134', '1116136', '859084', '141499', '757632', '722412', '896458']",264.0,359.0,32.0,4.23,1.0,1.0,0.03529709600810406,1.0,0.05112922729657947,0.05200536429549595,1.0,0.05738391456445404,0.05441026082407596,0.038305921196113854,0.036793563157520644,0.043039906798812436,0.04042902757862671,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's your belief system, and how a whole nation of Australians often long for a time when life was simpler, less complicated, more genuine . . . '
Sue Williams has long been fascinated by the Outback - its striking landscapes, the salt-of-the-earth characters it breeds, its wonders and its weirdness. But to date, her focus has been on others' lives.
Now putting her bravest foot forward, Sue sets out to see our country as it really is, warts and all. She accepts every new challenge that comes her way, including pregnancy-testing cows at a remote property, joining a cattle drive across Queensland, visiting the deadliest town in Australia, and fronting up to a ferocious fighter in the last boxing tent in the world.
It's tough for a city slicker, but she won't stop until she discovers what the 'real' Outback is all about.",[],20.0,288.0,8.0,3.73,0.14657797487930083,1.0,0.11862042669488469,0.1420636165483849,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1277877907947256,0.12301506044999318,0.11953004716858802,0.1135463120761419,0.14594661999923023,0.09933020882749427,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

95730,295000,Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism,eng,"In this modern spiritual classic, the Tibetan meditation master Chogyam Trungpa highlights the commonest pitfall to which every aspirant on the spiritual path falls prey: what he calls spiritual materialism. The universal tendency, he shows, is to see spirituality as a process of self-improvement--the impulse to develop and refine the ego when the ego is, by nature, essentially empty. ""The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use,"" he said, ""even spirituality."" His incisive, compassionate teachings serve to wake us up from this trick we all play on ourselves, and to offer us a far brighter reality: the true and joyous liberation that inevitably involves letting go of the self rather than working to improve it. It is a message that has resonated with students for nearly thirty years, and remains fresh as ever today.

On a spring morning in 1951, eleven-year-old chemist and aspiring detective Flavia de Luce gathers with her family at the railway station, awaiting the return of her long-lost mother, Harriet. Yet upon the train's arrival in the English village of Bishop's Lacey, Flavia is approached by a tall stranger who whispers a cryptic message into her ear. Moments later, he is dead, mysteriously pushed under the train by someone in the crowd. Who was this man, what did his words mean, and why were they intended for Flavia? Back home at Buckshaw, the de Luces' crumbling estate, Flavia puts her sleuthing skills to the test. Following a trail of clues sparked by the discovery of a reel of film stashed away in the attic, she unravels the deepest secrets of the de Luce clan, involving none other than Winston Churchill himself. Surrounded by family, friends, and a famous pathologist from the Home Office--and making spectacular use of Harriet's beloved Gipsy Moth plane, Blithe Spirit--Flavia will do anything, even take to the skies, to land a killer.

Levi, Ian, and Darius escaped death-by-wolf-pack by the skin of their teeth, but they're not out of the woods. The wolves are relentless. Help from humans? Not likely. Their only hope is a vampire commune in remote western Canada--if they make it in one piece. Even then, there's no guarantee they'll be offered sanctuary.
First challenge is to get there. Sunlight is deadly. Money is dwindling. Police and wolves alike are on the hunt.
Worse, Levi hasn't recovered physically or emotionally from the accident that broke several of his bones and killed his best friend. He desperately wants Ian or Darius to turn him, which would heal his wounds, speed their escape, and sever his last tie to the wolves that made his life hell.
Yet Darius hesitates, caught between his desire to help his lover, and fear that once this is all over, Levi and Ian will have no use--or desire--to keep him in the picture. And that's assuming they all make it to the end of this alive...
Warning: Contains two vampires and a werewolf who would really like to just sit down somewhere and lick their wounds, but are too damned busy stealing cars, avoiding sunlight, eluding police, arguing, jumping off roofs, and plotting new and innovative ways to weasel past customs.

A rising star in the world of public relations, Scott is a master at manipulating the news, especially when the news isn't good for his clients. To journalists, he's the dark prince of deception. To others, he's merely the product of an amoral corporate culture. Not that their opinions matter to Scott, who shelved his ego years ago. It's the only way to stay sane in a business that thrives on flying off the handle.
The trouble begins on the first day of Sweeps, when a fifteen-year-old girl goes on a fatal shooting spree in her high school cafeteria. For the news networks, it's a ratings bonanza, especially when clues suggest that the tragedy was loosely inspired by a popular rap song. Suddenly America's outrage is focused on Hunta, a young L.A. hip-hop artist who was on the verge of becoming a mainstream star. Now he's Public Enemy Number One, and his life is about to get infinitely worse.
Saving Hunta could be the crowning achievement of Scott's career, but he knows it won't be easy. To take control of the story, he'll have to upstage it. And to do that, he'll have to engineer a hoax more ambitious and more elaborate than any publicist has ever attempted before.

When she was just 12, she discovered the first whole ichthyosaurus skeleton; later, aged 22, she found the first whole skeleton of a plesiosaurus, and this find gained her international fame. She was unusual then - as she would be now - in being a woman geologist, and she was also a curiosity in being both provincial and lower class when science was dominated by upper class London gentlemen. During her lifetime she won the respect of contemporary scientists, receiving an annuity from the British Association for the Advancement of Science during the last decade of her life. Upon her death, Dickens wrote 'the carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it'. After her death, however, scientists wrote her out of their books, crediting instead the naturalists who had bought her specimens with her discoveries. It was inconceivable to them that an uneducated woman had produced such astonishing work. In this new book Patricia Pierce rescues the now little-known life of this extraordinary woman from undeserved obscurity to reveal her full and fascinating life",[],23.0,238.0,7.0,3.62,0.1502680354868231,0.14710396377560916,0.1489292176437384,0.15048032904066558,1.0,0.14639795296537425,0.16550560295744018,0.1430468752389461,1.0,0.1303146826836568,1.0,1.0,0.10331529247557508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Keener examines each paragraph for its function in the letter as a whole, helping the reader follow Paul's argument. Where relevant, he draws on his vast work in ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman sources in order to help modern readers understand the message of Romans according to the way the first audience would have heard it. Throughout, Keener focuses on major points that are especially critical for the contemporary study of Paul's most influential and complex New Testament letter. Endorsements: ""By grounding his exposition of Romans in the world of the first century, yet keeping his eye on the needs and concerns of the contemporary world, Keener offers here a rare commodity: a lucid commentary that is simultaneously conversant with the latest biblical scholarship and pastorally sensitive."" --John T.

Alone in her college dorm room, Denise attempts to understand how her suffocating middle-class upbringing has brought her to such an awful present. Ernaux, one of France's most important contemporary writers, daringly breaks with formal French literary tradition in this moving novel about abortion, growing up, and coming to terms with one's childhood.
""Written with raw and powerful images, Annie Ernaux says the 'unsayable' as she confronts the experience of having an abortion and of growing up in the post-World War II generationall in a fresh, original voice."" (San Francisco Chronicle 12-16-90)
""Without romanticizing or moralizing, Ernaux imaginatively and artfully presents a universal theme: the hopefulness and hopelessness of life."" (Library Journal 12-90)
""Cleaned Outis more than a powerful evocation of the class system in France in the 1950s and of one woman's struggle to move up in the class hierarchy and forget her past. It is also a novel that serves as a haunting contribution, both in subject matter and literary form, to the project of the culturally disenfranchised speaking in their own voice.""

31996,4030991,Shoe Dog,eng,"In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company's early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world's most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.
In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultraof all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.
But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business--a business that would be dynamic, different.
Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream--along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.","['7995778', '12250724', '25817524', '5996431', '26109437', '18858458', '25814087', '13175231', '22822856', '10859296', '276703', '17381351', '21412175', '7879590', '24612100', '26193026']",5174.0,384.0,204.0,4.44,0.15158626280734927,1.0,0.12320327029800718,1.0,1.0,0.15114590490675678,1.0,0.15026502151690305,0.12020930287362877,0.13169088336869203,0.11645392472489784,0.1393461243379498,0.11791195476701076,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sent by her family to work in a silk factory just prior to World War II, young Pei grows to womanhood, working fifteen-hour days and sending her pay to the family who abandoned her.
In ""Women of the Silk"" Gail Tsukiyama takes her readers back to rural China in 1926, where a group of women forge a sisterhood amidst the reeling machines that reverberate and clamor in a vast silk factory from dawn to dusk. Leading the first strike the village has ever seen, the young women use the strength of their ambition, dreams, and friendship to achieve the freedom they could never have hoped for on their own. Tsukiyama's graceful prose weaves the details of ""the silk work"" and Chinese village life into a story of courage and strength.","['11790127', '815786', '6562339', '3241816', '107456', '375500', '1798248', '209279', '204279', '361591', '335880', '139254', '6400109', '347913', '6519813', '194714', '11101788']",122.0,278.0,33.0,3.94,0.14365247852471444,0.14531245425949782,0.1347972780365794,0.1290345208733435,1.0,0.14618632634598,0.16121598165623005,1.0,0.15323237571859136,0.11078981908938763,0.1641785429656524,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Nella Larsen's novels Quicksand(1928) and Passing(1929) document the historical realities of Harlem in the 1920s and shed a bright light on the social world of the black bourgeoisie. The novels' greatest appeal and achievement, however, is not sociological, but psychological. As noted in the editor's comprehensive introduction, Larsen takes the theme of psychic dualism, so popular in Harlem Renaissance fiction, to a higher and more complex level, displaying a sophisticated understanding and penetrating analysis of black female psychology.","['11737010', '150354', '1426241', '160653', '50680', '217207', '105778', '69719', '2603', '129228', '51296', '40142', '18828', '55876', '210783', '6723170', '243991', '98687']",3136.0,246.0,103.0,3.91,0.10080118381068479,0.10222837853457357,0.08766176761064262,1.0,1.0,0.0965880384813331,1.0,0.09868819686826262,0.09132207099588989,0.08916121152240888,0.0972683496279505,1.0,0.0744151514112283,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

But in the country, Garnet finds herself under the supervision of equally oppressive guardians--her father's wealthy cousin and the matron's stuck-up daughter.

Olivia Bennett is a biographer, a narrator of lives far more interesting than her own. Orphaned as a child, she has always been fascinated by family relationships. When she volunteers to write down the memories of Eleanor Callaway, an elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer's, she gets caught up in a compelling story of a great love and a terrible secret. Suddenly, she is no longer a spectator but an investigator, and in her quest for truth, she finds herself at odds with Eleanor's sexy and very protective grandson, Colton Callaway.
Colton is a firefighter, a man used to going after what he wants and getting it. He pushes the limits, takes chances, and is willing to risk everything to save a life,
especially if that life belongs to his grandmother.
As Olivia and Colton stir up the smoldering embers of the past, they soon come to realize that the greatest danger may not come from those who want to protect their secrets but from each other. Because the one thing neither has ever been willing to risk is their heart.","['18668405', '13153801', '13263423', '73091', '13187657', '32307', '13357002', '1575123', '17348304', '17738326', '18343256', '593370', '525930', '2482710', '13516113', '12403736', '23493253']",598.0,200.0,47.0,4.25,0.16387598456906066,0.16579812192964033,0.15899447332231026,0.14502109641477334,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.15156552817843585,0.14969374774011585,0.1439799156957614,0.17146227352721014,1.0,0.10842968291435309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I wear scars on my body that will never go away, but the scars inside my head are far more difficult to overlook.
My brother doesn't know me, and if I have it my way he never will.
Life was going exactly the way I'd planned until Lille came along. She wanted to run away with the circus, have an adventure, but this world was never meant for her.
I try to keep her safe, because she doesn't know the dangers that are out here on the road. She doesn't know the monsters that lurk behind the bright lights of the ring. In truth, I could be considered one of them.

553261,3341611,Frontiersman: Daniel Boone and the Making of America,eng,"The name Daniel Boone conjures up the image of an illiterate, coonskin cap-wearing patriot who settled Kentucky and killed countless Indians. The scarcity of surviving autobiographical material has allowed tellers of his story to fashion a Boone of their own liking, and his myth has evolved in countless stories, biographies, novels, poems, and paintings. In this welcome book, Meredith Mason Brown separates the real Daniel Boone from the many fables that surround him, revealing a man far more complex -- and far more interesting -- than his legend.
Brown traces Boone's life from his Pennsylvania childhood to his experiences in the militia and his rise as an unexcelled woodsman, explorer, and backcountry leader. In the process, we meet the authentic Boone: he didn't wear coonskin caps; he read and wrote better than many frontiersmen; he was not the first to settle Kentucky; he took no pleasure in killing Indians. At once a loner and a leader, a Quaker who became a skilled frontier fighter, Boone is a study in contradictions. Devoted to his wife and children, he nevertheless embarked on long hunts that could keep him from home for two years or more. A captain in colonial Virginia's militia, Boone later fought against the British and their Indian allies in the Revolutionary War before he moved to Missouri when it was still Spanish territory and became a Spanish civil servant. Boone did indeed kill Indians during the bloody fighting for Kentucky, but he also respected Indians, became the adopted son of a Shawnee chief, and formed lasting friendships with many Shawnees who once held him captive.
During Boone's lifetime (1734--1820), America evolved from a group of colonies with fewer than a million inhabitants clustered along the Atlantic Coast to an independent nation of close to ten million reaching well beyond the Mississippi River. Frontiersman is the first biography to explore Boone's crucial role in that transformation. Hundreds of thousands of settlers entered Kentucky on the road that Boone and his axemen blazed from the Cumberland Gap to the Kentucky River. Boone's leadership in the defense of Boonesborough during a sustained Indian attack in 1778 was instrumental in preventing white settlers from fleeing Kentucky during the bloody years of the Revolution. And Boone's move to Missouri in 1799 and his exploration up the Missouri River helped encourage a flood of settlers into that region. Through his colorful chronicle of Boone's experiences, Brown paints a rich portrayal of colonial and Revolutionary America, the relations between whites and Indians, the opening and settling of the Old West, and the birth of the American national identity.
Supported with copious maps, illustrations, endnotes, and a detailed chronology of Boone's life, Frontiersman provides a fresh and accurate rendering of a man most people know only as a folk hero -- and of the nation that has mythologized him for over two centuries.",[],33.0,375.0,7.0,3.85,0.09543449997950672,1.0,0.08111068171570354,1.0,1.0,0.08418558701353587,0.08278262031698289,1.0,0.07633951801693246,0.07408021426025506,0.07875015637083745,0.09657416645924236,0.09049125624993477,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

That last takes time, but the resulting solitude weighs heavily. Until Cailin. He told himself a single night would have to be enough, but fate had other plans. Now he must choose between keeping his dirty little secret and fulfilling his promise to Sara Beth, or finding the strength to free them all from the secrets that bind them.","['18481675', '23491751', '18584542', '9242139', '25857826', '6383593', '6513168', '13545595', '33971463', '6086640', '18751232', '17734484', '1001762', '15996662', '2659255', '25749685', '21770900', '22913979']",59.0,170.0,11.0,3.53,1.0,0.1368386241401198,0.13091548465035144,0.09076392994557642,1.0,1.0,0.13808259448397367,0.09551761198202643,0.1357223731426758,0.10851723321689735,0.14215910903011106,1.0,0.0710691326558192,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

That book, Don Quixote, went on to sell more copies than any other book beside the Bible, making its author, Miguel de Cervantes, the most widely read author in human history. Cervantes did more than just publish a bestseller, though. He invented a way of writing.'
In Cervantes' time, 'fiction' was synonymous with a lie. Books were either history, and true, or 'poetry' which might be invented, but had to conform to strict principles. Don Quixotetells the story of a poor nobleman, addled from reading too many books on chivalry, who deludes himself that he is a knight errant and sets off to put the world to rights. The book was hugely entertaining, broke the existing rules, devised a new set and, in the process, created a new, modern hybrid form we know today as the novel.
The Man Who Invented Fictionexplores Cervantes's life and the world he lived in, showing how his life and influences converged in his work, and how his work - especially Don Quixote- radically changed the nature of literature and created a new way of viewing the world. Finally, it explains how that worldview went on to infiltrate art, politics and science, and how the world today would be unthinkable without it.",[],34.0,272.0,14.0,3.64,0.14719860531657292,0.15927027817703923,0.1179184855759302,1.0,1.0,0.14723082892669284,1.0,1.0,0.11190329302514489,0.11968451386193092,0.11581361770239185,0.14147136330862448,0.14048399371658968,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

25960,17852435,Benedict Cumberbatch: In Transition: An Unauthorised Performance Biography,en-US,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, War Horse, Star Trek: Into Darkness, The Hobbit trilogy, Twelve Years a Slave, August: Osage County, The Fifth Estate; Hedda Gabler, After the Dance, Frankenstein; Hawking, To the Ends of the Earth, The Last Enemy, Parade's End, and, of course, Sherlock. For most actors, these stellar cinematic, theatrical, and television events would be the highlights of a lifetime's work. On Benedict Cumberbatch's resume they are only a few of many entries. Especially since 2010, his performances have garnered a plethora of best actor awards, both in the theatre (Evening Standard Theatre Award, Critics Circle Theatre Award, and Olivier Award), by playing the dual roles of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature in the National Theatre's Frankenstein, and on television (Broadcasting Press Guild Award, Critics Choice Television Award, Crime Thriller Award, and TV Choice Award), by starring as the titular Holmes in the BBC's Sherlock. Add these and other recent accolades to nearly a decade's nominations and awards (such as the Golden Nymph as best actor in Hawking), and it's easy to see why Benedict Cumberbatch is often hailed as the actor of his generation.
Cumberbatch's body of work further includes indie films, radio plays and series, television documentaries, live dramatic readings, multimedia advertisements, and even the occasional stint as a fashion model. He often shares an intriguing perspective on his profession, as evidenced in sometimes controversial interviews. He has become so much in demand that online box offices crash when tickets for his performances go on sale, and, before a Cheltenham Literature Festival Q&A session, fans overwhelmed Twitter when so many responded immediately to a call for questions. Cumberbatch consistently is a top name on lists ranging from sex appeal to global influence. In 2012 he beat David Beckham in the former and U.S. President Barack Obama in the latter. Increasingly, part of Cumberbatch's job involves the role of celebrity.
Benedict Cumberbatch is at a pivotal point in his profession, and his career trajectory--especially as documented in entertainment media--permits a closer examination of just what it means to be a celebrity or star in Britain or the U.S. and how an actor may be perceived very differently in London or Hollywood. This performance biography is an analysis of a man in transition from working actor to multimedia star, as well as the balance between actor and celebrity. It looks at what makes this actor so well suited to play one of popular culture's iconic characters, Sherlock Holmes, and how Sherlock is so well suited to propel Cumberbatch toward greater global fame.","['389031', '109397', '474034', '16085502', '16234654', '7994265', '16290049', '505261', '14827498', '748550', '16068927', '26871', '11797922', '12903397', '3194018', '14492581', '2048281', '16101136']",60.0,356.0,9.0,4.03,0.08327942289388747,0.07646642412514898,0.07805341536572998,1.0,1.0,0.07004142831114024,0.0729682477598699,1.0,0.07122011306606951,1.0,0.07926236204372863,0.08309334718267718,0.07706718979585761,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

264740,23215762,The Penguin Book of Russian Poetry,eng,"An enchanting collection of the very best of Russian poetry, edited by acclaimed translator Robert Chandler together with poets Boris Dralyuk and Irina Mashinski
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, poetry's pre-eminence in Russia was unchallenged, with Pushkin and his contemporaries ushering in the 'Golden Age' of Russian literature. Prose briefly gained the high ground in the second half of the nineteenth century, but poetry again became dominant in the 'Silver Age' (the early twentieth century), when belief in reason and progress yielded once more to a more magical view of the world. During the Soviet era, poetry became a dangerous, subversive activity; nevertheless, poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Anna Akhmatova continued to defy the censors. This anthology traces Russian poetry from its Golden Age to the modern era, including work by several great poets - Georgy Ivanov and Varlam Shalamov among them - in captivating modern translations by Robert Chandler and others. The volume also includes a general introduction, chronology and individual introductions to each poet.

81003,7863998,The Feeling of Kinship: Queer Liberalism and the Racialization of Intimacy,en-GB,"In The Feeling of Kinship, David L. Eng investigates the emergence of ""queer liberalism""--the empowerment of certain gays and lesbians in the United States, economically through an increasingly visible and mass-mediated queer consumer lifestyle, and politically through the legal protection of rights to privacy and intimacy. Eng argues that in our ""colorblind"" age the emergence of queer liberalism is a particular incarnation of liberal freedom and progress, one constituted by both the racialization of intimacy and the forgetting of race. Through a startling reading of Lawrence v. Texas, the landmark legal decision overturning Texas's antisodomy statute, Eng reveals how the ghosts of miscegenation haunt both Lawrence and the advent of queer liberalism.Eng develops the concept of ""queer diasporas"" as a critical response to queer liberalism. A methodology drawing attention to new forms of family and kinship, accounts of subjects and subjectivities, and relations of affect and desire, the concept differs from the traditional notions of diaspora, theories of the nation-state, and principles of neoliberal capitalism upon which queer liberalism thrives. Eng analyzes films, documentaries, and literature by Asian and Asian American artists including Wong Kar-wai, Monique Truong, Deann Borshay Liem, and Rea Tajiri, as well as a psychoanalytic case history of a transnational adoptee from Korea. In so doing, he demonstrates how queer Asian migrant labor, transnational adoption from Asia, and the political and psychic legacies of Japanese internment underwrite narratives of racial forgetting and queer freedom in the present. A focus on queer diasporas also highlights the need for a poststructuralist account of family and kinship, one offering psychic alternatives to Oedipal paradigms. The Feeling of Kinship makes a major contribution to American studies, Asian American studies, diaspora studies, psychoanalysis, and queer theory.",[],71.0,251.0,7.0,3.86,1.0,0.046557377623354754,0.04769763172234059,1.0,1.0,0.05209286004589479,0.047495643177063264,1.0,0.05072427747595064,0.05074331173151126,0.04855270780685784,0.052191325658457514,0.046085785408184324,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The standalone follow-up to the serial trilogy that began the acclaimed New York Times & USA Today bestselling CAN'T RESIST series
Brian Sullivan has been in love twice in his lifetime. He lost his first love to early-onset Huntington's, and he lost the other more recently...to his brother. And somehow, his heart has managed to heal itself after both. Amazingly, without therapy. That doesn't mean Brian hasn't gotten more wary along the way, however. In fact, he's been thinking lately that maybe his brother's now retired nothing-but-flings rule isn't such a bad idea. Unfortunately, being the nice guy poster boy and all, he isn't exactly versed in the fine art of flings. So he looks to the outrageously 'unique,' provokingly button-pushingTessa Daniels for a crash course.
There's absolutely no way he's falling in love with this one...right?
Tessa has no idea what she was thinking telling Brian that she was some sort of fling expert. She's never been flung before and she sure as heck doesn't know where or how to begin flinging a guy like Brian. It was a temporary lapse in sanity, really--no doubt because of the can't-help-but-fall-for-him brain fuzz that hits her whenever he's around. Not only does the man have her being more herself than she's ever been in her life, but he's the only person she knows who seems to have as many demons and skeletons in the closet as she does. What's more, he's got her thinking of the one thing she stopped letting herself even hope for years ago.
A happily ever after.

In Laurent Binet's captivating debut novel, HHhH (Himmlers Hirn heiBt Heydrich, or Himmler's brain is called Heydrich), we follow the lives of Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubis, the Slovak and the Czech responsible for Heydrich's death.

As the founder and creative director of DwellStudio--which is famous for its brightly colored, graphic textile designs for home furnishings--designer Christiane Lemieux challenges tradition in a quintessentially American way, championing a fresh, unconventional approach to creating a beautiful and comfortable home. Lemieux emboldens readers to push aside stuffy, professionally-designed decor, showing them instead how to infuse their own personality into their home.
Undecorateprofiles twenty homes from all over the country, revealing their owners' love of imperfection and penchant for surprise and unusual juxtapositions while inspiring readers to follow their own whimsy and practicalities in their personal spaces. An anglophile creates an English manor in Hollywood, mixing British flea-market finds with midcentury furniture. A car fanatic turns a vintage Airstream trailer into a master bedroom and situates it in the middle of a vast industrial loft in downtown Chicago. A couple transforms a log house in Nashville, Tennessee, by blending their modern and eclectic styles with the home's rustic charm. Though the designs differ widely, the spaces all express an open-minded attitude. Some homes embrace their contexts, while others transcend them. All are shaped by instinct and imagination and share innovative ideas that readers can use to organically and elegantly create their home to match their lifestyle and tastes.
Lemieux gets to the essence of the homeowners' distinctive styles, pinpointing the transformative ideas, thoughtful details, and useful solutions that make each home memorable. With more than 200 full-color photographs, Undecoratewill both inspire and guide homeowners to a new outlook on home design.","['9675217', '10232994', '7641825', '1332474', '11855663', '7489083', '2858656', '867792', '6927668', '5990385', '172022', '10158809', '13330544', '885973', '18404145', '17398605', '14358654', '653399']",432.0,256.0,54.0,3.5,0.08106963896287506,0.0856197986580966,0.07318076021032967,0.08191041307928631,1.0,1.0,0.08997344625907847,0.07239173957979342,1.0,0.08104512405659564,0.08616424895733416,1.0,0.06324706265610539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I have not looked back since.
Although the homeschooling journey is difficult at times, if God has put you on this path and called you here, He will lead you through each day. We simply need to stop chasing things, and start chasing Him.
This book will encourage you to keep your focus on the One who has called you here. Through my personal story and experience, you will see what happens when we take our eyes off of Him, and how each day can look when we regain our focus, fix our eyes on Him and on the true goals of homeschooling...
""Maybe you are just starting out, or maybe you have been doing this awhile. Either way, there is most likely some amount of fear. Fear of the major responsibility that homeschooling is, or fear that you aren't doing it ""right."" Perhaps you are tired. Burnt out. Running on empty. Maybe you are up to your eyeballs in curriculum catalogs, reviews, planners, highlighters, label makers, and resources. Meanwhile the laundry calls, the dishes pile up, and the kids are tired. You are tired. You are trying to decide how on earth you are going to do it all. Or maybe you just are ready to throw in the towel altogether.
Well, take a deep breath. Relax. The One who created the universe in a breath, the One who called you to this journey, is in control. Yes, He is in control of your homeschool. Is anything too hard for Him?""

Mob boss Bernie Banks and his associates--John, Ben, and Jerome--differ from your ordinary Sicilian and Irish mob families. Two white, two black, they style themselves after the Rude Boy culture made popular in Jamaica.
Operating as a shell investment company supported by illegal activities, the Chimera Group hopes to become as powerful as other crime families and gain respect from the Cosa Nostra. Bernie, a war veteran of Jewish and Greek descent, begins his business in his apartment and grows it into a multimillion-dollar empire. He and his crew resemble a more sophisticated subculture of urban street gangsters with their Ray-Ban sunglasses, loafers, and debonair style. But they want fear and admiration.
Their efforts draw the attention of the rival Ambrosino family, and they face internal strife when one of the associates begins dating a former Playboy Club waitress who wants in on the group.
Will they make it to the top, or will they fall?

Reviewed by Romuald Dzemo for Readers' Favorite
A story that begins with someone spitting in another's face and getting tortured and killed for a secret he can't reveal immediately raises a lot of interest and curiosity in readers, but the grim fun is yet to begin. Rude Boy USA by Victoria Bolton is a riveting story of an unquenchable thirst for power and terror, featuring characters that will draw powerful emotions from readers. Bernie Banks has slowly but surely established himself as a powerful gangster with unusual but ruthless methods of operating. At a time he and his boys are sure to get on the top of the game, a powerful rival joins the game and a waitress causes a distraction that could break the solid Chimera Group. The big question is: who'll make it to the top in this game of power where no one accepts defeat?
Victoria Bolton's Rude Boy USA will take readers deep into the psychology of kingpins and the mechanics of the game of power. Bolton writes with unwavering confidence and grace, unveiling a plot that is laced with unusual turns and sudden surprises, a pace that quickens with the reader's heartbeat. The characters are as real as they are compelling, sometimes funny and at times very, very nasty. The language is blunt, so blunt the reader can squirm at times at what they hear. The dialogue comes off the pages naturally and draws readers in as the plot progresses to a rocket-like climax. This is a book I will gladly recommend to fans of thrillers and crime fiction. An enjoyable read indeed.","['30283468', '26200512', '28009289', '27571917', '26429253', '26720759', '27212866', '29487081', '29389230', '6944712', '27125600', '29155817', '25875539', '26781248', '26225422', '13574522', '25425791']",17.0,282.0,14.0,4.35,1.0,0.16819522929896824,1.0,0.12539785208871307,1.0,1.0,0.15915441839777375,0.1529063545521127,0.15015836717461759,0.12363180348972304,0.14168263313156057,0.14365917107716583,0.12248800937794053,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As a logician who likes simplicity, I should like to think that they are not, but from what I have read of them I am quite sure that he ought to have an opportunity to work them out, since, when completed, they may easily prove to constitute a whole new philosophy."" Philosophical Remarks] contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later philosophy of mind & of mathematics. Principally, he here discusses the role of indispensable in language, criticizing Russell's The Analysis of Mind. He modifies the Tractatus's picture theory of meaning by stressing that the connection between the proposition & reality isn't found in the picture itself.

Told through two haunting, interwoven diaries, Mia Couto's Confession of the Lionessreveals the mysterious world of Kulumani, an isolated village in Mozambique whose traditions and beliefs are threatened when ghostlike lionesses begin hunting the women who live there.
Mariamar, a woman whose sister was killed in a lioness attack, finds her life thrown into chaos when the outsider Archangel Bullseye, the marksman hired to kill the lionesses, arrives at the request of the village elders. Mariamar's father imprisons her in her home, where she relives painful memories of past abuse and hopes to be rescued by Archangel. Meanwhile, Archangel tracks the lionesses in the wilderness, but when he begins to suspect there is more to them than meets the eye, he starts to lose control of his hands. The hunt grows more dangerous, until it's no safer inside Kulumani than outside it. As the men of Kulumani feel increasingly threatened by the outsider, the forces of modernity upon their traditional culture, and the danger of their animal predators closing in, it becomes clear the lionesses might not be real lionesses at all but spirits conjured by the ancient witchcraft of the women themselves.

""Movie Museum & Breakfast""
Fifth of seven novellas in the ""Slumming in Paris, With the Children"" series.
Which is Part Six of my ""Slumming in Paris"" Series.
Part 6 is the fifth of seven novellas forming a subset with ""Slumming in Paris,"" additionally titled, ""With the Children.""
Further, an identifying title ""Part"" is given to each of the seven in the ""With the Children"" series. This book is ""Movie Museum & Breakfast."" The story continues with the children, and the adults having welcomed the arrival of their grandparents and small neighbor child, and the larger expanded family group venturing out into Paris together.
A full list of those titles, including all the currently named chapters (rather than numbered as in my previous work) is at the end of each book.
Parts 2 through 8 are comprehensive, with an over-arching theme and story of experiencing Paris, and finding what that experience means within. While Part One, ""Slumming in Paris, Arthur & Gricinda"" is more obviously focussed on the two adults, Parts 2-8 prominently feature the children.
Experiencing Paris is, in this work, both symbolic, and an engulfing immersion all its own.
The mystery, for each person who visits this wonderful city, is how to individually reconcile everything they have known before, and hope to know. And to know, in this instance, because there are so many characters, mostly young, is a variable thing.

America's economy is in shambles. . . .
Its citizens are terrified and dissatisfied. . . .
Could it all have been planned by a secret elite one hundred years ago?
The New World Order. Hitler referred to it in his diaries. President George H. W. Bush foretold of it in his speeches. Formed by a secretive global elite, the group seeking this new order has taken hold of the nation--and perhaps the world. Its influence pervades every reach of American society, from the products we buy at the grocery store to the topics of evening news programs.
But could it also be true that the New World Order caused one of the greatest financial catastrophes of our time?
For years, bestselling author and legendary conspiracy researcher Jim Marrs has exposed information that the mainstream corporate media has refused to report. Now, with a crisis upon us, Marrs has yet again unearthed the lies to expose the insidious alliances that make up a secret world.
Consider this: In 1910, a handful of the world's most powerful government and corporate men gathered on Jekyll Island to discuss matters at a private hunting lodge. The agenda? First, the overthrow of the sitting American president; second, the creation of a central bank, one headed by a succession of elitists who would unconstitutionally control America's money and its economy for decades. . . .
Flash forward one hundred years. Never before have the American people been so unhappy. Apathy and paralysis are the nation's guiding principles. Public education has repeatedly failed. More and more Americans rely on overpriced pills for remedies to fabricated illnesses. The average American household spends eight hours a day in front of the television, ruled by the vague fears of terrorist attacks and economic collapse. Control of the mass media has devolved to a mere five multinational corporations.
Throughout The Trillion-Dollar Conspiracy, Marrs investigates the erosion of America's civil liberties and the nation's transformation into a police state: Will the government use a microchip to monitor the populace? How does the Patriot Act relate to Nazi legislation? Have Americans today become merely a poor imitation of the robust citizenry of our nation's past?
Jim Marrs responds with a resounding call of ""Yes, we have!"" He also raises powerful questions about so many other things:
Was the financial bailout of 2008 nothing but one group of global elites passing money to another?
Could the swine flu epidemic have been corporately manufactured?
Is Big Pharm behind a lie that claims bipolar disorder is a real illness?
Has a Nazi bioweapon caused recent maladies such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome?
Why did the government suppress a device that can apparently cure cancer?
In the explosive The Trillion-Dollar Conspiracy, Marrs explores the back rooms and shadowy deals of our nation's past to craft a frightening history that no one else is brave enough to tell.","['6686737', '235158', '4238', '811022', '10255', '1790841', '1118037', '10359253', '15850477', '126321', '9626015', '98887', '124822', '298465', '13487747', '1781245', '91277']",350.0,496.0,37.0,3.9,1.0,1.0,0.21429721274953706,1.0,0.2292073899740697,0.20875701769130303,0.22296052824871782,1.0,0.2082996410634847,0.17901909955128772,0.20229556958336503,0.19627328378737666,0.19755254822732152,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

For centuries, the Vikings have swept out of the Norse countries and fallen on England, Ireland, whatever lands they could reach aboard their longships. Few could resist the power of their violent onslaught. They came at first to plunder, and then to settle, an encroachment fiercely resisted where ever they went. Such was the case in the southern lands of Ireland. En route to the Viking longphort there, known as Dubh-Linn, Thorgrim Night Wolf and Ornolf the Restless stumble across an Irish ship that carries aboard it a single item - a crown. The Vikings eagerly snatch the prize, unaware of its significance to the people of Ireland and the power granted to the king who wears it. Soon the Norsemen are plunged into the violence and intrigue of Medieval Ireland, where local kings fight with each other and with the invaders from the north for rule of the island nation. With enemies at every hand, and loyalties as fickle as the weather, Thorgrim must lead his men, the white invaders, the Fin Gall, in the fight of their lives, with both Irish and Dane eager to see them dead.","['12012003', '23123223', '13395122', '24516037', '16235128', '26124221', '11102997', '7770954', '10130633', '479602', '18842784', '25263371', '13422319', '1342780', '20429038', '12411943', '943289', '20621097']",95.0,288.0,19.0,3.83,1.0,1.0,0.0775966485364365,0.07065607868156841,0.08947807192289554,0.08036433849772373,1.0,1.0,0.08858341437341172,0.05599567687113897,0.07626784034265896,0.0765043535180642,0.07771563231392209,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An astro-guide with celebrity appeal
From the Dalai Lama to David Letterman, Princess Diana, Angelina Jolie and Tom Hanks, Star Power Astrology explores how remarkable people orbit into the public eye and seemingly repel the gravitational pull of everyday obstacles such as stress and chaos.

The astrology big boom theory
When times are tough people turn to astrology in a big way. When stocks go down, interest in astrology goes up. When the state of the union is somber, people seek sunshine and hope from the heavens. They want to know where to look for a job and how to nail the interview. They want to avoid getting snookered by the bank or their boyfriend--a gain.

Book Three in the Bay City Paranormal Investigations series.
While leading an amateur ghost-hunting expedition in Asheville, NC, Bay City Paranormal is called to investigate Sunset Lodge, a rustic inn situated on a remote Smoky Mountain peak. In recent weeks, employees and guests alike have seen a weird, frightening creature in the forest near the lodge. A creature which sounds all too familiar to the BCPI team.
Sam Raintree doesn't want to deal with another interdimensional gateway. The last one they faced nearly took the life of Sam's employer and lover, Dr. Bo Broussard, and Sam can't stand the thought of it happening again. Especially now that he and Bo are finally together and working through their problems. But Sam's psychokinetic abilities give him the power to permanently close the gateways, and he can't bring himself to ignore that. With the safety of the Sunset Lodge staff and guests at stake, Sam, Bo and their colleague, Dean Delapore, make the trip to the Lodge to determine if it indeed hosts a portal to another dimension.
Once at Sunset Lodge, a missing man, a grisly discovery and a moment of carelessness converge to reveal secrets much different--and far uglier--than any the BCPI team expected. Secrets which not only put their lives in danger, but which might provide Sam with an escape from the portals. If he's willing to take it.

268767,255773,"An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and Lesbian Public Cultures",en-US,"In this bold new work of cultural criticism, Ann Cvetkovich develops a queer approach to trauma. She argues for the importance of recognizing---and archiving---accounts of trauma that belong as much to the ordinary and everyday as to the domain of catastrophe. Cvetkovich contends that the field of trauma studies, limited by too strict a division between the public and the private, has overlooked the experiences of women and queers. Rejecting the pathologizing understandings of trauma that permeate medical and clinical discourses on the subject, she develops instead a sex-positive approach missing even from most feminist work on trauma. An Archive of Feelingschallenges the field to engage more fully with sexual trauma and the wide range of feelings in its vicinity, including those associated with butch-femme sex and AIDS activism and
caretaking.
An Archive of Feelingsbrings together oral histories from lesbian activists involved in act/up New York; readings of literature by Dorothy Allison, Leslie Feinberg, Cherrie Moraga, and Shani Mootoo; videos by Jean Carlomusto and Pratibha Parmar; and performances by Lisa Kron, Carmelita Tropicana, and the bands Le Tigre and Tribe 8. Cvetkovich reveals how these cultural formations---activism, performance, and literature---give rise to public cultures that both work through trauma and transform the conditions producing it. By looking closely at connections between sexuality, trauma, and the creation of lesbian public cultures, Cvetkovich makes those experiences that have been pushed to the peripheries of trauma culture the defining principles of a new construction of sexual trauma-one in which trauma catalyzes the creation of cultural archives and political communities.

Her choice in and attention to recalling specific stories that happen in physical reality are always aligned with the Highest Good in the way that they lead you to remember what truly matters to you, in a way that reminds you of your own truth--no matter how different or similar it is to hers. God Box is a beautiful work of art that reflects the simultaneous incredibly light and incredible dense world back to us. Anyone will be blessed and reconnected to everything holy after reading this book.""

It treats its pain as a rare gift, to be plumbed, excoriated, and conquered.

269021,28636,The Curtain: An Essay in Seven Parts,eng,"""A magic curtain, woven of legends, hung before the world,"" writes Milan Kundera in The Curtain, his fascinating new book on the art of the novel. ""Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore through the curtain. The world opened before the knight-errant in all the comical nakedness of its prose."" For Kundera, that curtain represents a ready-made perception of the world that each of us has--a pre-interpreted world. The job of the novelist, he argues, is to rip through the curtain and reveal what it hides.
In this entertaining and always stimulating essay, Kundera cleverly sketches out his personal view of the history and value of the novel in Western civilization. Too often, he suggests, a novel is thought about only within the confines of the language and nation of its origin, when in fact the novel's development has always occurred across borders: Laurence Sterne learned from Rabelais, Henry Fielding from Cervantes, Joyce from Flaubert, Garcia Marquez from Kafka. The real work of a novel is not bound up in the specifics of any one language: what makes a novel matter is its ability to reveal some previously unknown aspect of our existence. In The Curtain, Kundera skillfully describes how the best novels do just that.","['10508', '46958', '18930', '16570', '113410', '16942', '350271', '8031504', '4629012', '80795', '384221', '25565136', '318116', '381161', '418824', '300570']",1231.0,176.0,102.0,3.97,0.0823230452036413,1.0,0.06072138520297135,1.0,0.07980250769563955,0.08228593567722059,1.0,1.0,0.06124567684843669,0.06564848667670682,0.0687006534565314,0.0691385827401268,0.07540070687023678,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
565747,76336,The Last Town on Earth,eng,"Set against the backdrop of one of the most virulent epidemics that America ever experienced-the 1918 flu epidemic-Thomas Mullen's powerful, sweeping first novel is a tale of morality in a time of upheaval.
Deep in the mist-shrouded forests of the Pacific Northwest is a small mill town called Commonwealth, conceived as a haven for workers weary of exploitation. For Philip Worthy, the adopted son of the town's founder, it is a haven in another sense-as the first place in his life he's had a loving family to call his own.
And yet, the ideals that define this outpost are being threatened from all sides. A world war is raging, and with the fear of spies rampant, the loyalty of all Americans is coming under scrutiny. Meanwhile, another shadow has fallen across the region in the form of a deadly illness striking down vast swaths of surrounding communities.
When Commonwealth votes to quarantine itself against contagion, guards are posted at the single road leading in and out of town, and Philip Worthy is among them. He will be unlucky enough to be on duty when a cold, hungry, tired-and apparently ill-soldier presents himself at the town's doorstep begging for sanctuary. The encounter that ensues, and the shots that are fired, will have deafening reverberations throughout Commonwealth, escalating until every human value-love, patriotism, community, family, friendship-not to mention the town's very survival, is imperiled.
Inspired by a little-known historical footnote regarding towns that quarantined themselves during the 1918 epidemic, ""The Last Town on Earth"" is a remarkably moving and accomplished debut.","['278053', '10659750', '6593158', '11911674', '321623', '6688453', '198686', '63671', '230221', '7662575', '6051946', '10616505', '6495476', '4745776', '8143073', '2385370', '6947944', '257460']",4386.0,387.0,744.0,3.6,1.0,0.1495448449770748,0.12488816414642043,0.12262872111157294,1.0,1.0,0.14763835600632183,0.14167638782049025,0.14780858904230204,0.11702100038138535,0.13458133654706425,1.0,0.140524210732759,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

From recounting the visions Black Elk had as a young boy, to his involvement in the battles of Little Big Horn and Wounded Knee, as well as his journeys to New York City and Europe with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, this biographical account of Black Elk--an Oglala-Lakota medicine man (1863-1950)--follows him from childhood through adulthood. S. D. Nelson tells the story of Black Elk through the medicine man's voice, bringing to life what it was like to be Native American in the mid-to-late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. The Native people found their land overrun by the Wha-shi-choos, or White Man, the buffalo slaughtered for sport and to purposely eliminate their main food source, and their people gathered onto reservations. Through it all, Black Elk clung to his childhood visions that planted the seeds to help his people--and all people--understand their place in the circle of life. The book includes archival images, a timeline, a bibliography, an index, and Nelson's signature art.

VF-9 was activated in March 1942 as part of Carrier Air Group (CAG) 9, one of the many air groups the US Navy was hurriedly forming in the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
Equipped with Grumman F4F Wildcats, VF-9 first saw combat during the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942, where the squadron engaged Vichy French fighters over Morocco. Returning to the United States, VF-9 became one of the first squadrons to receive the Grumman F6F Hellcat and to deploy on the USS Essex, the first of its class of fleet carriers that would form the backbone of the US Navy's Fast Carrier Task Force. VF-9, the Hellcat, and the Essex all entered combat in the fall of 1943.
In the hands of the squadron's pilots, and with other Navy fighter squadrons, the Hellcat proved superior to the Imperial Japanese Navy's A6M Zero, which had heretofore been the world's premier carrier fighter plane. During its second combat tour, beginning in August 1943, VF-9 participated in the initial stages of the US Navy's successful island-hopping campaign across the Pacific.
Flying strikes against Marcus Island, Wake Island, Rabaul, the invasions of Tarawa and Kwajalein, and the attack on Truk, VF-9 helped prove the Hellcat as a fighter and supported CAG-9 in its relentless attacks on Japanese forces, helping to validate the concept of the multi-carrier task force and the new carrier doctrine that led to the US Navy's complete defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy. During its second combat tour VF-9 claimed 120 Japanese aircraft and produced the first Hellcat ace in Lt(jg) Hamilton McWhorter and nine additional aces. VF-9 began its third combat tour in February 1945 aboard the USS Lexington, shifting to the USS Yorktown a month later. The squadron participated in the February strikes against Tokyo and played a significant role in the Okinawa Campaign from March to June 1945.
Now equipped with the F6F-5 Hellcat, the squadron claimed 130 Japanese aircraft shot down. Ten VF-9 pilots became aces during the campaign, most notably Lt Eugene Valencia, who ended the war as the second highest scoring Hellcat ace and tied with Lt Cecil Harris as the US Navy's second highest scoring ace overall with 23 victories. Valencia's division became famous as the most successful fighter team in the US Navy during World War 2, claiming a combined total of 43 Japanese aircraft. In addition VF-9 had one of the US Navy's few nightfighter aces in Lt(jg) John Orth, who flew an F6F-5N Hellcat.",[],2.0,96.0,1.0,4.5,1.0,1.0,0.05514025707960477,0.06944522239875732,0.06835429346387813,0.05418017378996899,0.06228298492634861,1.0,0.05879592370526182,0.057360420465332955,0.053289606671049546,0.056478576188666994,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I've vowed to keep my distance, but the pull of his magnetism grows ever stronger even as the headstone symbols lead me closer to truth and to the gossamer veil that separates this world from the next.","['8786358', '9862105', '9585036', '15746858', '11476593', '9467196', '10661603', '10765906', '10165210', '12104686', '7823038', '9565045', '12905583']",115.0,366.0,29.0,3.92,0.09030806202729204,0.08236341203267601,1.0,0.06505373155882999,0.08562559705790122,0.07857720307979489,1.0,0.0682616219354693,1.0,0.06022876670389092,1.0,0.07610354148149236,0.05700445700839039,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
2059,28819137,"The Long, Long Life of Trees",eng,"A lyrical tribute to the diversity of trees, their physical beauty, their special characteristics and uses, and their ever-evolving meanings
Since the beginnings of history trees have served humankind in countless useful ways, but our relationship with trees has many dimensions beyond mere practicality. Trees are so entwined with human experience that diverse species have inspired their own stories, myths, songs, poems, paintings, and spiritual meanings. Some have achieved status as religious, cultural, or national symbols.
In this beautifully illustrated volume Fiona Stafford offers intimate, detailed explorations of seventeen common trees, from ash and apple to pine, oak, cypress, and willow. The author also pays homage to particular trees, such as the fabled Ankerwyke Yew, under which Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn, and the spectacular cherry trees of Washington, D.C. Stafford discusses practical uses of wood past and present, tree diseases and environmental threats, and trees' potential contributions toward slowing global climate change. Brimming with unusual topics and intriguing facts, this book celebrates trees and their long, long lives as our inspiring and beloved natural companions.",[],63.0,296.0,17.0,3.82,0.05834526020712453,0.06151761115884579,0.053694307357731653,1.0,1.0,0.06905528916022405,0.07030193573792613,1.0,0.05668493866490403,0.06364486401542721,0.054087646463578026,1.0,0.05280501704636914,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The noble Antonio Foscarini stands accused and pays the ultimate price. Gerolamo Vano, General of Spies, provides the evidence. But who is really guilty? By the end of the year, Vano is swinging from the gallows in Piazza San Marco, while Foscarini is absolved posthumously. Pistols! Treason! Murder!uncovers the shadowy world of seventeenth-century espionage and the truth behind the most infamous miscarriage of justice in the history of Venice.
Including vividly illustrated comic strips, accounts of the author's bar tour around contemporary Venice, and painstaking detective work, Jonathan Walker's story of the rise and fall of a master spy is compelling and highly original.
In untangling the career of the master spy Vano, Walker invites the reader into the historian's task of piecing together evidence from incomplete archival sources, making sense of motives, coming to terms with the story, and knowing when the job is done.

Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.
She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable--the big surprise comes when Matilda discovers a new, mysterious facet of her mental dexterity. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth.

Barcelona, 1945-just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother's face. To console his only child, Daniel's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel's father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Windby one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax's work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.","['6304285', '40440', '11033', '177076', '54984', '12527544', '5983202', '56412', '733768', '67006', '6746018', '13129612', '7776251', '6489636', '6065179', '3388', '15888', '1528410']",1139.0,403.0,165.0,4.25,0.1617674704256591,1.0,0.14236900173582004,0.1287795491639977,1.0,0.16205375866233687,1.0,0.15056619718745584,0.1466692099773478,0.11374747458423305,1.0,0.1613903018578681,0.1413274605494958,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

27480,54594,"The Complete Peanuts, Vol. 2: 1953-1954",eng,"The second volume is packed with intriguing developments, as Schulz continues to create his tender and comic universe. It begins with Peanuts' third full year and a cast of eight: Charlie Brown, Shermy, Patty, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy, the recently-born Linus, and Snoopy. By the end of 1954, Pigpen and his dust cloud join the crowd. Linus, who still doesn't speak, begins to emerge as one of the most complex and endearing characters in the strip: garrulous and inquisitive yet gentle and tolerant. And, in this volume, he acquires his security blanket! Charlie Brown is becoming his best-known self, the lovable, perpetually-humiliated round-headed loser, but he hasn't yet abandoned his brasher, prankish behavior from Volume One. And, Lucy, this book's cover girl, has grown up and forcefully elbowed her way to the center of the action, proudly wearing her banner as a troublemaker, or, in Schulz's memorable phrase, a ""fussbudget"". For readers unfamiliar with the early years of the strip, Snoopy's appearances here may come as the biggest surprise: he behaves, for the most part, like a dog! But, although he doesn't yet walk upright, sleep on top of his doghouse, or possess a fantasy life, Snoopy has started thinking for himself and his evolution continues its fascinating course within these pages. If you watch carefully, you'll catch his very first shark impression. The vast majority of the daily and Sunday strips collected here are not currently available in any in-print Peanuts collection. Dozens of them have not been reprinted since their initial appearance in newspapers over 50 years ago.

Actually, reversing the direction of numbers and letters remains one of the most common challenges faced by children when they are first introduced to writing - a struggle that may take some up to two years to overcome. The book presents a unique and effective approach to writing numbers and letters, resulting in tremendous reduction of this common letter reversal downtime experienced by children in their early learning years.
The book uses the simple concept of the left and right directions, colorful, eye-catching illustrations,the concept of concentrating on the few to learn the whole, and the magic of music in learning.

These lessons are ideal for use with college students, community groups, faith communities, parents/family groups, and more. There are 12 professional development lessons that, when used in combination with the foundational lessons, will help providers build skills towards providing transgender affirming services, including: K-12 professionals, college/university professional staff, medical, mental health and social service providers.
With particular attention paid to intersectional approaches and marginalized identities, these lessons are complemented by extensive foundational knowledge about transgender people's identities and experiences, detailed guidance on how to plan, facilitate, and navigate the nuances of teaching about transgender-related topics, and resources to build further knowledge.

enterprise in American history. Selling everything from lawn
mowers to Pop Tarts to wine-cask-sized jars of dill pickles,

That is, until an employee at an outlet in
small-town Jackson, Missouri launches a wildcat strike. Then
company owner Dave Blandine, a retail legend known for
merciless cost-cutting and a glass eye the size of a doorknob,
decides to take a stand against organized labor.
He sends his half-witted son and heir, along with the
megalomaniacal head of a security company and nine heavilyarmed
agents to quell the unrest. They are met by Jackson's
sharp-as-a-blade lady mayor, and its laconic, marijuana-smoking
police chief who is famous for his two-gunned marksmanship.

local manager, a sycophantic nebbish with a penchant for
Byronic poetry, and his wife, a 15-year-old girl in a 25-year-old

Prince Corin and Prince Laen, united against the light fae, are battling their way to the capital, Aos SA, where Corin will claim the Kingdom for his own.
The land is pleading for a new leader, someone to save it, and the people, from its treatment at the hands of King Auberren but has Corin waited too long... has he time enough to do what he must as the land screams for him in his mind, pushing his sanity to the limits of what he can bear?

She has photographed rarely seen sites from domains including: science, government, medicine, entertainment, nature security and religion. This index examines subjects that, while provocative or controversial, are currently legal. The work responds to a desire to discover unknown territories, to see everything. Simon makes use of the annotated-photograph's capacity to engage and inform the public. Transforming that which is off-limits or under-the-radar into a visible and intelligible form, she confronts the divide between the privileged access of the few and the limited access of the public. Photographed with a large format view camera (except when prohibited), Simon's 70 color plates form a seductive collection that reflects and reveals a national identity.

No one else his age lives in an antiques shop, for one thing, and he's been trained to pay attention to every detail he sees, able to discover a person's life story in the setting of their watch or the tread of their shoes.
For someone with an almost photographic memory, all this makes him more than a little unusual. But even he is surprised by the turn his life takes when his grandfather hurries him from home and drops him at the airport with a flight to London, leaving him little direction besides the tantalizing revelation that his life is much more than he thought it was.
That he was born into a secret society of Finders and Keepers, people who reclaim lost artifacts and return them to their rightful owners, for a price. As soon as he lands, Chris is joined by a team of Finders whose one goal is to locate the most legendary artifact in history before it's used to overthrow the monarchy. An artifact most people don't even believe exists.
They're looking for Excalibur, and Chris is the only person in the world who can lead them to it.

The customers and the friends of our star employees are a hoot as well. We also get to meet some of the men and women of the local Police Department too.

This book is a quick read. It will bring you up to speed on all the issues of this campaign season. It examines the issues from various vantage points and includes some great out-of-the-box ideas. It also makes our economic conundrum easy to understand. It even offers common-sense solutions to our economic woes. Of course, the solutions require leadership to bring them to life. But, at least this book shows that we can fix our problems.
The message most Americans are hearing is: class warfare versus trickle down and more versus less regulation. In other terms: big versus small government. This is NOT what this campaign SHOULD be about. Neither camp is talking about what this campaign should be about. Maybe they do not get it, or maybe they do not believe enough in themselves to take it on.
We are in a death spiral of political gridlock. Washington is not able to practice the art of politics (which is compromise) because of ideological self-righteousness.
This book uncovers the real issue facing America - the lack of leadership and the political sport that has caused Americans to despise the ""other side"" - and even despise other Americans that support the other side.
Finally, this book shines the light of the American ideals. It also shines the light on our bright future and how we will get there! It is chock full of insights and out-of-the-box solutions. It should be a must read for our next president! It will definitely make the campaign spin-machines realize that they are out of touch with we independent voters.

Statements.

Endless dialogue.

Rebuttals.

Resignation.

Hana has settled into married life and adores her handsome husband and child, relishing this fortunate second chance at love.
A series of unexpected encounters conspire to rock her emotional world and cause mayhem in Hana's life, dragging her past into her present life and causing friction with Logan. Hana's former life in England suddenly refuses to stay there, seeking her out and forcing her to face a number of issues which she believed she had left behind, old resentments and conflicts that she would rather not face now.

But its grasping fingers will not be satisfied with one death and Hana will be floored by the loss of someone close to her. As always, life in the New Zealand city of Hamilton is never dull, casting its rich tapestry of influence over the inhabitants of the prestigious private boys' school. Yet nobody could have foreseen the dreadful outcome of a harmless day out, which will threaten the security of the little Du Rose family forever.

. . . was how Norman Mailer predicted the tumultuous period that led to President John F. Kennedy's 1963 murder on a public street and the fifty years of controversy that have followed that turning point in our nation's history. Journalist and historian Joseph McBride, a volunteer in JFK's 1960 Wisconsin presidential primary campaign, began studying the assassination minutes after it happened. In 1982, McBride launched his own investigation. Both epic and intimately personal, Into the Nightmare: My Search for the Killers of President John F. Kennedy and Officer J. D. Tippit incorporates rare interviews with key people in Dallas, archival discoveries, and what novelist Thomas Flanagan, in The New York Review of Books, called McBride's ""wide knowledge of American social history."" McBride chronicles his evolving skepticism about the official story and shines a fresh, often surprising spotlight on Kennedy's murder and on one of the murkiest, most crucial aspects of the case, its ""Rosetta Stone,"" the Tippit killing.
Joseph McBride has been a journalist since 1960, writing for such publications as Life, The New York Review of Books, The New York Times Book Review, The Los Angeles Times Magazine, and, on this subject, The Nation.

385055,25498935,A Framework for the Study of Grid Inter-Operation Mechanisms,eng,"The study of the history of computing infrastructures reveals an integration trend. For example, the explosive growth of the Internet in the 1990s was the result of an integration process started in the 1960s with the emerging networks of computers. By using the Internet, millions of users were capable of accessing information anytime and anywhere, much like other daily utilities such as water, electricity, and telephone. However, an important category of users remained under-served: the users with large computational and storage requirements, e.g., the scientists, the companies that focus on data analysis, and the governmental departments that manage the interaction between the state and the population (such as census, tax, and public health). Thus, in the mid-1990s, the vision of the (Computing) Grid as a universal computing utility was formulated. The main benefits promised by the Grid are similar to those of other integration efforts: extended and optimized service of the integrated network, and significant reductions of maintenance and operation costs through sharing and better scheduling. While the universal Grid has yet to be developed, large-scale distributed computing infrastructures that provide their users with seamless and secure access to computing resources, individually called Grid parts or simply grids, have been built throughout the world---in different countries, for different sciences, and both for production work and for computer-science research. At the same time, the main technological alternatives to grids, that is, supercomputers and large clusters, have evolved into much larger, scalable, and reliable systems. Thus, the integration of existing grids into larger infrastructures and finally into The Grid is key in keeping the grid vision attractive for its potential users. The integration of grids raises a double challenge, one related with the efficient scaling of a distributed computing system, the second associated with the operation of a system across different ownership and administrative domains. Thus, many of the traditional approaches for inter-operating computer systems, such as those based on completely centralized or purely decentralized system architectures, are eliminated from the start. To mark the distinction between the typical problem of integrating smaller components into a larger system and the double challenge of grid integration, we call the latter the problem of grid inter-operation. In this thesis we approach the problem of grid inter-operation with two main objectives: to design a comprehensive framework for the study of grid inter-operation mechanisms, and to provide an initial but good solution for this problem. We design a framework for the study of grid inter-operation that includes a toolbox for grid inter-operation research and a method for the study of grid inter-operation mechanisms. In the research toolbox we include the Grid Workloads Archive (GWA), a comprehensive model for grid resources and workloads, the GrenchMark performance evaluation framework, and the Delft Grid Simulation (DGSim) framework for repeated and realistic simulations of multi-cluster and multi-grid environments. The GWA and our comprehensive model show that grid computing is mostly used in practice for single-processor jobs and not for parallel computing, which raises previously ignored challenges related to the volume of jobs to be managed. We also devise in this thesis a method for studying grid inter-operation mechanisms. We answer using our framework important questions regarding existing grid operation mechanisms, and in particular show that these mechanisms are too limited to cope with real and realistic conditions. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by designing Delegated MatchMaking, a novel mechanism for inter-operating grids. This mechanism is used to operate an architecture that is a hybrid between hierarchical and purely decentralized architectures. The Delegated Matchmaking mechanism attempts to use the local resources of a grid as much as possible and also transparently extends the local environment with resources obtained (delegated) from other sites when resources are not available locally. Our approach is compared with five alternatives through trace-based simulations, and is found to deliver the best performance, especially when the system is heavily loaded. While many other mechanisms can be designed in the future, our experiments prove that the Delegated MatchMaking approach already is a good solution for the problem of grid inter-operation. Our experiments also demonstrate that having grids inter-operate leads to better performance than having the same grids operate independently.",[],1.0,191.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.03095781429572979,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.028649112332039272,0.027720125700574673,0.029832636126101292,0.029651977587656777,0.029141486219571137,0.029237319582685706,0.030824401681755813,0.024547238481389913,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
313685,22007613,CAMILLE'S TRAVELS,eng,"Camille MacTavish is a seventeen-year-old runaway escaping an abusive home life with a stolen magic dragon in the pocket of her jeans. Which could be fun, if the dragon didn't attract all the wrong people.
The magical trinket (a netsuke in the shape of a dragon) isn't what it seems. Although Camille thinks it's a luckpiece she stole as a souvenir from her last ""ride,"" Philip, it's actually the protrusion into this dimension of a powerful magical entity from another plane of existence. Philip is a sorcerer, and he sets out to track her down, retrieve it, and kill her (thereby gaining power through sacrificing her to his personal demons.)
Once she realizes what's happening, Camille begins running for her life. The magic she unwittingly wields (after the ""luckpiece"" is attuned to her) but cannot control gets out of hand, and the battle becomes far larger and more perilous--not only for Camille, but for the friends she has made on the road and at the Renaissance festival where she found work. Worse, she's having to fight the magic because it may be capable of controlling her--which could lead her down the path that Philip chose. She and her new friends she met on the road (the disenfranchised) must defeat the dark forces quickly to prevent a rending of the very fabric of space-time.
Some may call the subject matter ""gritty,"" but it's realistic; the desperation felt by some teens who feel they have no choice but to leave home to escape the abuse (and it is never as simple as ""go to foster care"" or ""call CPS"") and the issues they face are only sidelights here, but what there is, the author faces head-on. Camille may start out as somewhat of an antihero (as the book opens, she's shoplifting food and cigs), but readers quickly learn that at the core, we're all much more the same than we are different, and that there are always reasons for the ways people act.

The saga of THE SANDMAN encompasses a series of tales unique in graphic literature and is a story you will never forget.
They have had many names: The Erinyes. The Eumenides. The Dirae. The Furies. Agents of vengeance, implacable and unstoppable, the y do not rest until the crime they seek to punish is washed clean with blood. It is to them, THE KINDLY ONES, that Lyta Hall turns when her baby Daniel is taken from her, and it is Dream of the Endless who becomes their target. But behind a mother's grief and unyielding rage, there are darker forces at work, and what they set in motion will eventually demand a sacrifice greater than any the Dreaming has yet known.
THE KINDLY ONES is the ninth volume of eleven in THE SANDMAN LIBRARY. These books can be read in order or as individual volumes.","['151872', '21324', '109243', '22422', '102956']",1787.0,352.0,137.0,4.59,1.0,0.10923757993171429,1.0,0.10565065858789495,1.0,0.10435962522049383,1.0,0.11246201890567187,0.11670720993440759,0.09393259776146139,0.11112147085806805,0.10473399303184523,0.07872021499795354,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

283933,36442446,Edward Freer Hills's Contribution to the Revival of the Ecclesiastical Text,eng,"This book comprises an excellent history of how the church has treated the text of the Greek New Testament since Reformation times. In Chapter 1 the author documents which text the Reformers used and how they handled textual issues, including variant readings. John Calvin, Theodore Beza, John Owen, and Francis Turretin are singled out as examples of the Reformation approach to the text of the word of God.
In Chapter 2 he deals with how the Princeton theologians handled these issues in the nineteenth century. Starting with Archibald Alexander, Charles Hodge, and Caspar Wistar Hodge, who basically maintained the Reformation stance (the latter less consistently) he then gets right to the crux of the issue, the views of B. B. Warfield. Warfield is shown to be the man who radically altered the church's views with respect to the text of the New Testament, introduced textual criticism to Princeton, and altered its views of both the inspiration of and the preservation of the text as set forth in the Westminster Confession of Faith. Warfield is shown as having both denied the historic doctrine of the providential preservation of the text of God's word and relegating the attributes of inerrancy and inspiration to the original autographs only, thus leaving the church without belief that it possesses an infallible and inerrant word of God.
In Chapter 3 he documents Hills' life long battle to undo the damage wrought by Warfield's apostasy from the Reformation position with respect to the text of God's word, while at the same time giving the reader a fascinating biography of this unique man. The book concludes with a comprehensive bibliography for serious students of this issue. It is well written, concise, and easily comprehended by the layman, while providing much needed support for embattled pastors seeking to defend the word of God.",[],1.0,177.0,1.0,5.0,0.07178222677365574,0.06969142226608445,0.0617702830293548,1.0,1.0,0.06656352373879416,1.0,1.0,0.0600216848072527,0.06244707775739725,0.05892671535946813,0.0733135085633263,0.04564231190555562,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Alice stood, clutching the table. ""She has no idea who she's dealing with. Let's go scope out her office.""
They moved down the hall, past the women's red bathroom door on the left, the men's blue door opposite. Alice held one side of Ruby's walker with Henry on the other side. They turned the corner just as Melanie pulled her office door closed and walked toward the exit. Head bent, she spoke in whispered tones into her cell phone.
Alice used her eyes to indicate, ""Let's go."" As they shuffled past the office door, the group moved into slow motion. Alice reached out her hand and tested the door handle as they glided past. She whispered, ""It's locked tighter than a face lift. Who knows how to pick a lock?""
Henry and Alice looked at Ruby.
""Why are you both looking at me? Well, okay, but I don't have a kit with me... I mean, I'll need a couple of items."" She noticed her friend's mouths as they hung open. ""Don't worry. I'll go visit old Smurf in the other block. He'll have a kit. No burglar, I mean locksmith, would be without one. Wait for me in the lounge, and I'll be back in a jiffy.""
Alice and Henry walked in silence to the lounge and parked on the three-seater couch. When a woman with long silver hair tried to sit on the spare seat, Alice pulled a cushion onto it and said, ""Sorry, there's someone sitting there.""
""Where?"" The woman looked over the top of her tortoise shell spectacles. ""You're a fruitcake."" Her pink slippers shuffled across the carpet tiles as she moved away.

By sunset, there were 57,470 men--more than half the size of the present-day British Army--who lay dead, missing or wounded. On that day hope died. Juxtaposing the British trench view against that from the German parapet, Kershaw draws on eyewitness accounts, memories and letters to expose the true horror of that day.

152518,15784539,Soiling Solutions® The Clean Kid Manual V: Treatments for Bowel and Bladder Control,eng,"Soiling Solutions(r) was founded in 1998 by Robert W. Collins, PhD, PC, a behavioral medicine oriented psychologist who validated the specific mechanism underlying the bedwetting (enuresis) alarm.
However, his interest was quickly diverted to soiling issues or Encopresis where the reactions are much more intense and distressing for everyone concerned. Feces are a smelly, very offensive, disease-bearing body product. Fecal incontinence is the number two reason why older persons may be placed in nursing homes. Adults with Irritable Bowel Syndrome may be fearful of going out of the house. Children eventually go into complete denial when they cannot control it.
The frequent result is called Functional Fecal Retention, or FFR, accompanied by a megacolon or enlarged colon caused by repeated and desperate holding and toileting refusal by the child. This can cause problems with bladder function and has other damaging and ongoing physical consequences.
The present dominant form of treatment is merely ""maintenance therapy"" with stool softeners and laxatives offered with a hope and a prayer that the condition will resolve itself in time. Soiling Solutions(r) is an aggressive, home-based treatment that works much more quickly in ending soiling, lending hope to all, and leading to an eventual cure though a training process where the daily treatment hour shortens over time as the child's body/mind takes over by a natural conditioning process.

What started in 2011 as a poorly-xeroxed cry for artistic solidarity in the form of a zine, morphed into an open-sourced platform of expression. A like-minded community of artists was formed: poets, authors, artists, photographers, columnists, videographers, journalists, and many more joined together from all over the country to make the eclectic issues a reality. In those flimsy paper copies, the soul of The Radvocate was forged, an irreverent but proud spirit which carries on to this day.
In 2015, So Say We All, a San Diego-based literary arts non-profit, joined with The Radvocate to release a new kind of literary magazine. The goal was to shine it's own way in the face of conformity, to create a radical space for fiction, non-fiction and poetry to flourish. In a departure from the norm, the work that is and will be featured in The Radvocate champions a new kind of community, free of the traditional boundaries and procedures of other lit mags.
What you hold in your hands is the result of that thinking, the combined efforts of talented up-and-coming writers and a small team of dedicated individuals who believe in our cause. We have a simple objective: to plant our flag in the soil of literary arts and fly it high, letting those who would criticize think what they may. Where others would wait around to wait for someone to give them their chance, we are carving our own niche in the face of indifference, screaming our existence to the world.

She told Lori, ""We all have two lives and we carry the maps of those lives with us. Our left hands mark the lives we're born with. Our right hands mark the lives we make for ourselves.""
Belief Is Its Own Kind of Truth, Maybeis a book about mapping those lives - the lives we are born with and the lives we are allowed - and lucky enough - to make for ourselves.
Beliefis part adoption narrative and part meditation on family, motherhood, nature vs. nurture, and what it means to make our own authentic human connections. It extends the possibilities of creative nonfiction at a time when many people are talking about what exactly truth-in-memoir means. The book's patchwork form mirrors the fragmented experience of being an adoptee confronting -- and trying to heal -- her roots.
Beliefis the story of one woman's search for her birth mother coupled with the parallel story of her own motherhood and her own re-making. It's about what it means to be a mother, what it's like to have two very different blood connections, and what it means to form a family.
Beliefis about searching for roots and what that means, exactly. It's about finding a balance between the families we're born into and the ones we make ourselves.","['13162275', '22929483', '480338', '21567470', '22271828', '415574', '1169656', '16140599', '748302', '713948', '16075239', '2740043', '609912', '16121278', '18722801', '180723', '70505']",75.0,293.0,25.0,4.53,0.2201020802870708,0.21943587508138496,0.22797644773601672,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.24125042432964344,0.2406680021149572,0.2185114989926296,0.1987847444365215,0.21398647843057195,1.0,0.15295380733564987,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Authors James Layton and David Pierce have uncovered original artwork, studio production files, behind-the-scenes photographs, personal papers, unpublished interviews, and a host of other previously unseen documentation. The book offers a richly illustrated narrative of the film's production, with broader context on its diverse musical and theatrical influences. The story concludes with an in-depth look at the challenges Universal overcame in restoring the film in 2016. Additionally, the book's appendix provides a comprehensive guide to all of the film's performers, music, alternate versions, and deleted scenes. ""King of Jazz"" was one of the most ambitious films ever to emerge from Hollywood. Just as movie musicals were being invented in 1929, Universal Pictures brought together Paul Whiteman, leader of the country s top dance orchestra; John Murray Anderson, director of spectacular Broadway revues; a top ensemble of dancers and singers; early Technicolor; and a near unlimited budget.
The film's highlights include a dazzling interpretation of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which Whiteman had introduced to the public in 1924; Walter Lantz's A Fable in Jazz, the first cartoon in Technicolor; and Anderson's grand finale The Melting Pot of Music, a visualization of popular music's many influences and styles.
The film is not only a unique document of Anderson's theatrical vision and Whiteman's band at its peak, but also of several of America s leading performers of the late 1920s, including Bing Crosby in his first screen appearance, and the Russell Markert Dancers, who would soon become Radio City Music Hall's famous Rockettes",[],3.0,304.0,1.0,5.0,0.09851107062264595,0.10349044277555577,0.09083374362463992,1.0,1.0,0.11320023205946647,0.11786898799906323,1.0,0.08277900821090486,1.0,0.08179452034969902,0.11431904440804191,0.0934447376880664,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Moved by the beauty of the country and the richness of her experiences, she began to share her adventures through the written word as well. Her blogs soon gathered a captivated following, and so the seeds for this book were sown.
Initially conceived as a short, literature-inspired tour of Great Britain, Ms. Rothstein's itinerary evolved into a three-month adventure of a lifetime. To her surprise and delight, the extended duration allowed for a deeper experience gained by slowing her pace and taking the time to let life happen.
In this volume, the author shares, vividly and humorously, accounts of the places she and her husband visited on their travels through Scotland. The inspiration she draws from her journey--as well as the breathtaking photographs--will motivate others to follow in her path. She also offers a thoughtful and practical guide to planning and organizing an extended trip, from how to set up an itinerary to packing a three-month wardrobe in a single suitcase.

A vast movement of positive thinking took the twentieth century by storm and engulfed every area of our lives-including our churches. Put simply, positive thinking became a part of what it means to be an American.
But should it be part of what it means to be a Christian?
L.L. Martin exposes the eye-opening history of this movement, documenting its roots in occult, mystical, and Eastern religious ideas. Though Christianity came under its power, the two philosophies stand in stark conflict. As a result, Christ was dethroned and the self was made sovereign, rewiring our minds and weakening our faith.
This practical book, immersed in Scripture, seeks to reestablish you in a God-centered life.
* Deepen your spiritual walk by embracing honesty.
* Discover the neglected paradoxes of Christian living.
* Learn to live in the grace by which you were saved.
Positively Powerless will help you detect the false gospel of positivity and reconnect to your true source of power: the gospel of Jesus Christ.

In the fall of 2013, while at a crossroads in life after a divorce, Aaron Lauritsen, did what many of us dream of doing but few ever will, he put his problems in the rearview mirror and headed out the door. After selling his business and all his possessions, he and his trusty K9 companion, Athena-bear, jumped in his Toyota pick-up truck, then ventured into the heart of North America for a road trip to end all road trips.
Because he hoped that by getting lost out there, he would somehow find himself again, he left without a plan or even a map, then for one hundred glorious days journeyed the continent carefree, via secondaries that were not only off the beaten track, but that were often all but forgot.
On them he traversed some 30,000 zig-zagging miles through thirty eight of the lower forty eight states and seven of the ten Canadian provinces. And yielded in the process an untold number of encounters weaved by confronting personal fears, history, worldly cities, eccentric people and adventurous activities. The real prize afforded by the time, distance and space however, was his spiritual awakening.
Follow along as he paints that epic voyage of discovery and experience the same unexpected serendipity that awaited them around each bend of the open road.","['370373', '8942672', '28672267', '243196', '21803292', '20932825', '22071309', '19332804', '22678914', '18346698', '20758075', '2035286', '27984081', '21488201', '713664', '17300236', '12648447']",9.0,366.0,3.0,4.58,0.11175651747085072,0.11975429766331912,0.09931755864025453,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1147958343786632,0.11055573843991998,0.10025396681868791,0.10202263391843679,0.0978621912700596,1.0,0.08418871331155936,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

31984,18402066,Killing Christ: Contesting Trendy Critics Regarding The Death and Resurrection,eng,"An extraordinary conspiracy of injustice, cruelty, as well as religious and political interests sentenced an innocent man to the cruelest method of execution ever developed. Yet, the target was no mere victim, He was the Redeemer. Jesus as God and man came to die in the place of humanity. The Bible, Talmud, Mishnah, and Roman historians reveal that the Son of God was illegally arrested, tried, and executed.
How did such a thing come to be? Who were the spectators, the authorities, frauds, and scoundrels? Why was Christ's arrest illegal under Hebrew law? What was it like at Gethsemane during the arrest, or in the chambers of the chief priest as the interrogations of Jesus took place? What can an apologetics approach, using Hebraic sources, tell us about the meaning of the last words Jesus uttered on the cross? With the massive amount of evidence for the resurrection of Christ, why can we go beyond probability to full certainty that Christ is risen?
""Killing Christ: Contesting Trendy Critics Regarding The Death and Resurrection of Jesus"" will answer those questions in a way that will keep the pages turning.
""In Killing Christ,"" Robinson invites you to experience the most stunning injustice in the history of civil law, conjoined to the supreme triumph of the power of God, and the redemption provided by the death of Christ. The author provides a chronological examination that includes a detailed look at everything from rabbinical law to Roman justice to Christ's courtroom declarations of His divinity. This new volume furnishes a readable examination and analysis of the indictments, preliminary proceedings, trials, and execution of Jesus--great for apologetics and the defense of the faith.
""Killing Christ"" reveals the truth about:
* The Arrest of Jesus Christ
* The Various Trials of Christ: An Apologetic Approach
* The Errors of the Trendy Critics (Bill O'Reilly, Aslan, Ehrman, etc.)
* The First Good Friday and Its Redemptive Provision
* The ancient Rabbinic, Roman, and Non-biblical historical accounts
* The Proof of the Resurrection of Christ: The Facts within an Assured Rational Framework
* Who Really Killed Jesus?
* The Evidence of The Historicity of Christ's Life, Death, and Resurrection
With all the skeptical assaults on the meaning of the death, life, and resurrection of Christ, this innovative volume is a must for every Christian, minister, and apologist--it will be a book that you will give away many times to friends. This is so because it is serious (it contains informed analysis of relevant biblical truths), rational (it is well-argued), potent (it holds the reader's attention through gripping illustrations), and spiritual (it will set you ablaze for God).
The publication of ""Killing Christ"" is indeed an event. What is intended here is an account of the arrest, trials, death, and resurrection of Christ which does justice to the full sweep of biblical testimony and the ancient historical sources (the Talmud, Mishnah, Targums, Dead Sea Scrolls, and Roman archives). What is accomplished is something on the order of a vigorous defense of Christian truth--an appropriation of the data, evidence, and facts within a synthesis of the foundational necessity of Christian theism.
""Killing Christ"" is a valuable resource for students of the gospels, and a highly stimulating volume for all interested in Christian truth. The section on the harmony of the Gospel accounts, regarding the trials and crucifixion, alone makes this a valuable tool for apologetics. It will be hard to come away from this book without a feeling of having been enriched and challenged. This is a book that will be formative for average Christians and scholars as well as students and pastors--the author is clear, accessible and passionate.

""In An Ember from the Fire, a sequence of poems based on the life of Fanny Van de Grift, especially concerning her marriage to Robert Louis Stevenson, Jane Bonnyman provides a series of vignettes which are quiet, yet unsettling, rich, and evocative. The quality of the writing is delicate and finely controlled.

The always edifying and often hilarious adventures of the Fariyaq, as he moves from his native Lebanon to Egypt, Malta, Tunis, England and France, provide the author with grist for wide-ranging discussions of the intellectual and social issues of his time, including the ignorance and corruption of the Lebanese religious and secular establishments, freedom of conscience, women's rights, sexual relationships between men and women, the manners and customs of Europeans and Middle Easterners, and the differences between contemporary European and Arabic literatures.

""Engaging lyric poetry that manages to be sensual and cerebral, fun and profound.
Readers willing to dig deeper than the work of poets Derek Walcott, Linton Kwesi Johnson and Anthony Joseph will find that exciting new worlds of Caribbean poetry await. Although some lesser-known Caribbean writers tend to get bogged down in the exotic fecundity of their island landscapes, others write with a grace and steadiness that highlights personal experience within the larger context of culture and environment to reveal something universal. Trinidadian novelist, painter and poet Drayton (The Crystal Bird, 2012, etc.) most decidedly falls into the latter category. Her personal poems often focus on singular moments in her past, yet her evocation of the slippage between past and present, of how we manage to exist in both times simultaneously, speaks directly to readers. The exploration of how ""time...magically overlaps generations"" pervades this collection. Her narrators are buffeted by nostalgia, but are never fatalistic or cloying; instead, they treasure the past and the present as a single fabric of interwoven threads. One narrator, for instance, revisits a memorable beach and finds that the ""scenery I knew has all but gone, / except for the sea. /Longing and waiting, I dream of the days / that never can be again. / The sea waits while I dream a dream / where I stand on the balcony of this precious day."" Drayton invests symbols with a similar complexity; the titular brown dove, for instance, is at once a symbol of maternal devotion, sexual allure, rebellion and quiet endurance, and rife with gender and racial resonances. Occasionally her more contemplative poems suffer from excess erudition, and she is sometimes prone to distracting alliteration, but she also delivers unmatched similes such as, ""The morning stormed my day / like a drunken party crasher / with streams of gold and white ribbons / coming through the window.""

Is there a sensibility unique to a country or its people, directly flowing from their cultural conscious? Apart from the poet's own sensitivity to the influences around him, the sensibility relates to the people who form his milieu. An Indian poet writing in English will draw from his own cultural conscious and incorporate in his vision complex aesthetic influences working on him to produce poetry that relates to his people. Such work will still have some appeal to a global audience because the English that results is a unique creation of Western expression with Indian flavor. The myths that form the stuff of poetry may have been born in the Indian soil but its memes, defined as units of cultural expression, will always have something in them to appeal to a much wider audience. We do not have daffodils in India for a Bloomsbury poet to write poems about. But we have our own unique sensory influences to work upon. But essentially poetry remains a universal experience that is enjoyed by audiences anywhere in the world. The 175 -odd poems in this collection are rooted in Indian sensibility.

Praise for Your Life Idyllic:
""A stunning debut of startling power and vision. I found myself recalling the thoughts and feelings I had entertained when I first read Ray Carver, Richard Ford, Jayne Anne Phillips, and Thom Jones. I believe Bernier's book belongs on the shelf next to these aforementioned wonderful and important writers. Bernier tells stories of struggle and survival in the lives of ordinary, marginalized people, vividly capturing their sense of stubborn, even heroic striving. These are beautifully achieved stories, wrought in a prose crafted and contoured with a kind of sculptor's touch, evoked in crystal-bright incidents which bend neither to sentiment nor easy bitterness. Indeed, it is this muscular lyricism with its intense, edgy, dangerous pleasure that sets him apart as a new voice to be reckoned with."" -- Chuck Kinder, author of Honeymooners: A Cautionary Taleand Snakehunter
""These mighty stories of Detroit give us a great soul struggling up from ruin, full of grace, courage, and a hopeful heart. No one knows the city better than Bernier, and no one writes about it with anything like his tender and glorious savagery."" -- Michael Byers, author of Percival's Planetand The Coast of Good Intentions
""The stories in Craig Bernier's Your Life Idyllic are brimming with straight-up Detroit authenticity. Full of bowlers, boozers, truckers, and factory rats, not to mention Madonna-loving, yoga-practicing blacksmiths, these characters are Motor City to the bone. Equal parts grit, spirit, anger, pride, and intelligence. Read this homeboy. Bernier writes as if his life depended on it. I have a feeling that it did."" -- Michael Zadoorian, author of The Leisure Seekerand The Lost Tiki Palaces of Detroit

Physicians, dietitians and trainers have come to treat ""carbs are bad"" as a new gospel, preaching a lifestyle that strays very far from the true scientific consensus. In ""What Is Fat For?"" Ignatius Brady, a weight loss physician and science writer, presents a fresh perspective on obesity based on critical new research that has gone largely overlooked.
The protein leverage hypothesis holds that neither dietary fat nor dietary carbohydrate ""cause"" us to gain weight. The obesity debate is re-framed as an imbalance between ""protein"" and ""non-protein"" energy. This imbalance has caused a widespread human adaptation: the obesity epidemic.
In a thorough yet readable style, the book takes the reader through normal human weight regulation, the time frame needed for weight loss, and what's missing in the ""carbs are bad"" thinking. This is not a diet book, but a scientific exploration of the inner workings of human biology and our interactions with the modern nutritional environment. The question, ""What is fat for?"" drives this narrative, which takes nothing for granted, analyzes all possibilities, and presents detailed evidence for the reader's best judgment.

95621,23526234,The American Revolution: Writings from the Pamphlet Debate 1773-1776,eng,"For the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolution, acclaimed historian Gordon S. Wood presents a landmark collection of British and American pamphlets from the political debate that divided an empire and created a nation: In 1764, in the wake of its triumph in the Seven Years War, Great Britain possessed the largest and most powerful empire the world had seen since the fall of Rome and its North American colonists were justly proud of their vital place within this global colossus. Just twelve short years later the empire was in tatters, and the thirteen colonies proclaimed themselves the free and independent United States of America. In between, there occurred an extraordinary contest of words between American and Britons, and among Americans themselves, which addressed all of the most fundamental issues of politics: the nature of power, liberty, representation, rights and constitutions, and sovereignty. This debate was carried on largely in pamphlets and from the more than a thousand published on both sides of the Atlantic during the period Gordon S. Wood has selected thirty-nine of the most interesting and important to reveal as never before how this momentous revolution unfolded. This second of two volumes follows the course of the ultimate crisis that led from the Boston Tea Party to the final break, as the focus of debate turns from questions of representation and rights to the crucial issue of sovereignty. Here is a young Thomas Jefferson offering his radical Summary View of the Rights of British America;Samuel Johnson pronouncing Taxation no Tyrannyand asking ""How is that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negros?""; Edmund Burke trying to hold the empire together in his famous Speech on Conciliation; and Thomas Paine turning the focus of American animus from Parliament to king in the truly revolutionary pamphlet Common Sense. The volume includes an introduction, headnotes, a chronology of events, biographical notes about the writers, and detailed explanatory notes, all prepared by our leading expert on the American Revolution. As a special feature, each pamphlet is preceded by a typographic reproduction of its original title page.",[],4.0,995.0,2.0,5.0,0.10250612457692992,0.10338493857558542,0.07730810036408124,1.0,1.0,0.07963476563363535,0.08484124255377869,1.0,0.07563379779883374,0.0827050372352529,0.07773770800322095,0.09250750619225281,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
580896,13424056,Completely in Blue: Dispatches from the Edge of Insanity,eng,"Psychosis can single-handedly ruin everything about you in the blink of an eye. Your mind is broken into pieces; shattered from the inside out. Your thoughts race and spiral out of control. It is as though someone else' mind has taken control of your own. You are no longer yourself. You are no longer anyone. You are no longer a part of this world.
You could believe that you have supernatural powers, or that the laws of the universe simply do not apply to you. You could believe that you are a world famous musician, an accomplished scholar or that your private helicopter is about to pick you up from the roof of the psychiatric hospital.
Rarely do we ever get a glimpse inside the mind of someone suffering psychosis. This is likely because it is such a terrifying ordeal that most do not wish to, or have the energy to, live through it again by writing about it.
But Chris Curry knew that as soon as the 'bullet-proof door closed in the Bubble Room, the orderlies held me down, the needle went in and the straightjacket was affixed' that he was in the midst of a story that needed to be told.
Completely in Blue: Dispatches from the Edge of Insanity gives you a bird's eye view into the series of unfathomable events that led up to his ultimate psychiatric hospitalization of three months. He leads you on an adventure into the extreme capabilities of the human mind, and shows you how extensive drug abuse can lead you from a nice, laid back musician to a ravaged, violent and escape-prone criminal in a matter of months.
Enter into Chris' shattered mind as he slowly becomes convinced that he is a world-famous musician, starts a riot in his former high school, sells drugs for biker gangs, spends his nights dealing MDMA in seedy strip clubs, lights himself on fire with Bacardi 151, repeatedly gets detained by the police and is ultimately taken into custody at gun point after escaping from psychiatric custody.
""""Sex, drugs and rock and roll meet the mental health 'system.; For anyone who takes sanity for granted, this insanely self-revealing memoir will rock your world. Highly recommended.""""
Dr. Paul Fedoroff, M.D. Chair, University of Ottawa Division of Forensic Psychiatry.
Although this book does provide an inside look into the broken mind of an 18-year old, it is ultimately about recovery. The slow, often painful rise up from a broken existence that even those closest to him feared that he wouldn't survive.
Curry now works as a public speaker, mental health stigma blogger and mental health and addictions counselor and through his life's work has proven that no matter how dire the circumstances are, recovery is always possible.
""""Ultimately, this is indeed a story of recovery, one that inspires optimism no matter how long or difficult that journey might be... This book should be required reading for high school and post-secondary social science programs and valued as a guide by mental health practitioners committed to eliminating the stigma of mental illness."" ""
- Dr. Pamela Prince, Director - Strategic Planning and Evaluation, The Royal
According to Dr. Gabor Mate, the pioneer of the safe-injection site in Vancouver's Downtown East Side and award-winning author, it is a """"very personal and wrenching description of mental illness. Very honest; very vividly written.""""
If you, or someone you love, is suffering from mental illness or addiction, this book is a must-read.

21267,21373504,To The Sea: Thirty Two Poems from Godey's Lady's Book,eng,"Godey's Lady's Book, begun in 1830 and edited after 1836 by Sarah Josepha Hale, was one of the most popular magazines in nineteenth century America reaching every state and territory. Reading its poetry, authored by both amateurs and professionals, allows us to share in the emotional and intellectual experiences of these Americans in a unique way. This volume contains thirty one poems about the sea and its role in nineteenth century life. Twenty five are from Godey's and six are from Hale's earlier publication, the Ladies' Magazine (1829-1836).
The nineteenth century was still the age of sail; ships not only crossed the globe but also served much of the country's population by transporting a wide variety of commercial goods and passengers. Port cities (large and small) up and down the east coast carried on lively domestic and foreign trade, and much of the nation's population lived near the coasts. Death at sea was a real possibility, and in some areas coastal residents not infrequently found bodies of unknown men and women washed up on shore. Saying goodbye to a loved one at the start of a voyage came with the recognition that the voyager might not return. It was natural to express one's relationship with the ocean in poetry; the sea was, and still is, a powerful and awe inspiring force of nature.
The Godey's Poetry series is made up of 18 volumes based on a variety of themes. In addition to this volume, you might be interested in:

563967,17303775,Offerings to the gods in Egyptian temples,en-US,"Kings and gods adorn the walls of Egyptian temples in face-to-face meetings, and for two millennia these depictions have united the king and the divine. The king, the son of the god, presents his ancestors an offering or performs a ritual.
Over two hundred offerings are divided into broad categories: purification, beverages, foods, produce from the fields, fabrics, ointments and adornments; rituals for goddesses and gods; symbolic, cosmic, funerary and defensive rituals; and royal cult rituals. All are explained, from their simple action (e.g. offering beer as a daily drink) to their symbolic meaning (beer is also a sacred drink that induces ecstasy of a divine nature which annihilates the destructive force of the daughter of Ra). A drawing and photographs illustrate each offering. The title of the offering is given in hieroglyphs to enable everyone to locate the words on the temple walls. Translations of the most significant texts accompany each of the offerings. Most of the texts in this book date to the last period of Egyptian history (Graeco-Roman period, 300 B.C. to A.D. 300) where the decoration is enriched with complex inscriptions, written in so-called ""Ptolemaic"" that very few Egyptologists are able to translate.",[],5.0,282.0,2.0,4.8,1.0,1.0,0.04659177713719163,0.05073679549058205,0.057704335973516596,0.05296588101491183,1.0,1.0,0.05378653581290242,0.04209891764342588,0.043404420441182534,0.050923160362847386,0.04541123493961041,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
